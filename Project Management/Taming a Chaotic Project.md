# Taming a Chaotic Project

It happens to projects big and small: one day, you wake up to a mess in your workspace. Sometimes it’s because of a colleague who can’t load-balance, or a budget decision that left you with fewer resources. And in a certain sense, it doesn’t matter why the project got off track – but it definitely matters how you untangle it.

## 1. Recognize Warning Signs and Act Fast

Project snags don’t magically resolve themselves. The earlier you face these problems in the project’s lifecycle, the more options you have to resolve them.

Throughout the life of the project, get regular status updates. Encourage your team to forecast their remaining work, factoring in any project plan changes so that potential slippages are identified as soon as possible. Use collaborative project management software to keep everyone clear on where the project—and their responsibilities—stands at all times.

## 2. Find Out What’s Gone Wrong

Don’t rush into a fix without first identifying why. Without taking the time to understand the root cause of the problem, any proposed solution will be a shot in the dark. Start by talking to your team. Get their view on what’s hot and what’s not, and elicit their ideas for a solution. Your team’s engagement and commitment to any new plan going forward will be the critical contributor to its success.

And a heads-up: When the going gets tough, these information-gathering exercises can deteriorate into finger-pointing sessions so don’t let that happen. Instead, press for accurate information on how to reprioritize and restructure tasks. Team members might be reticent when it comes to delivering bad news and may choose to do so in bits and pieces. Be clear that you need all of the bad news right now, otherwise you’ll be re-structuring the plan every week as the news rolls in incrementally. Be sure to share what you find so that subsequent chaotic projects don’t suffer the same issues.

## 3. Revisit the original plan.

Don’t forget why you’re doing the project in the first place. Review the original business case and check in from time to time to verify that it’s still valid. It’s easy to focus on doing whatever’s needed to hit that next deadline, but be aware of what that mono-focusing does to the overall project (and the consequences it has on any projects that follow). You might be able to hit that deadline by throwing additional resources at it, but if this plan trashes the overall budget and subsequent delivery schedules, then that’s not the way to go. You want to play the long game here.

Don’t be afraid to consider the effects of killing the chaotic project and walking away. In reality, this is rarely an option as it can be devastating in terms of customer relations and company reputation, but you should always weigh it up. A dogged determination to see a project through is admirable, but if it makes you unable to deliver on other commitments, it can be catastrophic for your organization. Review the financial and your resources against the overall business plan. If the chaotic project isn’t going to deliver what it set out to do, then look at how you can really get there at this point in the project.
