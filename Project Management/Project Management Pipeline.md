# Project Management Pipeline

Having a good plan is the most important strategy for getting a project **done**.

## Step 1: Collection

Collect *all* work related items that are part of the project, including:

- Physical Handwritten Notes and Brainstorms
- Meeting/Call Agendas and Notes
- Emails/Correspondence with Client
- Open Tasks in Task Manager
- Open Github Issues
- Slack Messages
- Data received from client
- etc. 

After collecting, prioritize the pieces as tasks that are part of the project - if get stuck prioritizing ask yourself:

1. Which one has the most immediate hard deadline?
2. Which task will make the most positive effect if it is finished ASAP?
3. Are any of these tasks dependent on another one?
4. Am I dependent on another person to complete something else before starting?
5. Is there a task that I must get off my plate to clear my mind and move forward?


## Step 2: Develop a Process

Next, outline and list out all the necessary steps to complete each task, asking these three questions:

1. What are all the tasks and micro-tasks that must be done to complete this?
2. Who needs to weigh in on, contribute to, perform a quality assurance check on, or sign off on the work?
3. Is this the most efficient way to get from A to Z on this particular project?

## Step 3: Get Organized

Committing to being organized and finding a structure that fits the project's needs gives a fresh insight into what needs to get done, re-prioritized, or reorganized. 

Set a time each week, such as every Friday afternoon or Monday morning, to review work items. This not only keeps your mind fresh but also helps you see all the things that are part of a bigger project and vision. Change happens, so you’re probably updating a lot of tasks in the course of a week. This review process will help you stay on top of your moving work

## Step 4: Just Do It

Now that you’ve completed the first four steps, it’s time to take action. Pull the trigger; press publish; deliver the final product. What do you do _right now_?

Based on David Allen’s GTD methodology, consider these four things:

1.  **Context.** What can you do right now?
2.  **Time available.** What do you have time to do right now?
3.  **Energy available.** What are you able to accomplish right now?
4.  **Priority.** After answering the first three questions, start working on the highest priority item.
