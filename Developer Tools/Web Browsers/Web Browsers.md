Chromium ![[chromium_96px 1.png]]

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web.

The project's web site is [https://www.chromium.org](https://www.chromium.org/).

To check out the source code locally, don't use `git clone`! Instead, follow [the instructions on how to get the code](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/docs/get_the_code.md).

Documentation in the source is rooted in [docs/README.md](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/docs/README.md).

Learn how to [Get Around the Chromium Source Code Directory Structure](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/getting-around-the-chrome-source-code) .

For historical reasons, there are some small top level directories. Now the guidance is that new top level directories are for product (e.g. Chrome, Android WebView, Ash). Even if these products have multiple executables, the code should be in subdirectories of the product.



Currently my primary web browsers are:
- [Microsoft Edge Canary]
- [Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition]

Other popular options are:
- [Chromium]
-
