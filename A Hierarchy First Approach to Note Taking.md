My primary use for notes is as a cache. Think Redis, but for humans. %% highlight_id: 113319192 %%


If I spent more than 5 minutes figuring something out, those are five minutes I never want to spend again figuring out the same problem %% highlight_id: 113319191 %%


My solution is something I call hierarchal note taking. It’s a system I’ve developed over the past ten years that has allowed me to amass a corpus of +10k notes. %% highlight_id: 113319190 %%


it lets me find any specific note within seconds even with thousands of existing notes %% highlight_id: 113319189 %%


it helps me build a comprehensive mental model around a domain through the act of organizing my notes %% highlight_id: 113319188 %%


it can be used on any note-taking tool that supports markdown notes %% highlight_id: 113319186 %%


it’s compatible with existing note-taking methodologies like PARA %% highlight_id: 113319184 %%


I created a folder called notes. I created a note called tar.md %% highlight_id: 113319182 %%


Note that my tar.md note doesn't have every option or use case involving tar. Instead, it's only the options that I find most useful and use cases that I've had to do. This tends to be my approach to note-taking - I like to capture the bare minimum information I need so that the future me can get value out of the note %% highlight_id: 113319180 %%


What started as a single markdown file quickly spawned a few hundred more. It was exhilarating — instead of turning to google every time I ran into a dusty corner of Linux, I could just reference my notes. 95% of the time, there would be a nicely summarized note waiting for me :) %% highlight_id: 113319178 %%


Take python as an example. Python is both a programming language as well as a cli command. Without changing the name of one of the notes or introducing folders, there would be no way to create notes on both. %% highlight_id: 113319176 %%


But I didn’t want folders. Folders were messy and besides, weren’t supported in notational velocity, my primary note-taking tool at the time. So instead of folders, I decided to create a hierarchy using the . symbol as my delimiter. %% highlight_id: 113319174 %%


And whereas folders were traditionally used to organize information, there was no straightforward way to use a folder hierarchy to quickly find information. Having the hierarchy in the filename made it easy to find information using the hierarchy %% highlight_id: 113319172 %%


As I started building hierarchies across more and more domains, I found that it became useful to document what they were. I called these externalized hierarchies schemas. They were a table of contents for a particular hierarchy. I started adding a special schema file directly underneath the root of each hierarchy. %% highlight_id: 113319170 %%


I would use schemas as a common source of truth when building out a hierarchy and use them to make sure that each hierarchy was internally consistent. As I began to use this system day by day, I realized that I had stumbled upon a radically more effective way of learning. %% highlight_id: 113319168 %%


By associating every note I took to a hierarchy, I found that looking up information no longer felt like an tax on my time, but instead, a path to self augmentation. %% highlight_id: 113319166 %%


I’ve also expanded my schemas and have migrated from free form bullets to a structured YAML syntax. %% highlight_id: 113319162 %%


Over 50 years ago, Vannevar Bush, an early visionary in information science, said something about the field that strikes a deep chord with me. %% highlight_id: 113319160 %%


“We are overwhelmed with information and we don’t have the tools to properly index and filter through it. [The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist” — Vannevar Bush, 1945 %% highlight_id: 113319159 %%


Dendron is my attempt at building a tool that will give humans access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages %% highlight_id: 113319158 %%


I’ve expanded my use cases of note-taking beyond caching to also include journaling, task management, creating writing, keeping track of interactions, and lots more. %% highlight_id: 113319164 %%
