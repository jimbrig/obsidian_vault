# Publishing Workflow

Instead of paying for the built-in [Obsidian Publish Feature](https://obsidian.md/publish) this workflow utilizes the fast, simple, and nice looking [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) static sit generator to publish an Obsidian Vault.

## Initial Setup

- Fork the Obsidian-MkDocs github repo template from [jobindj/obsidian-mkdocs](https://github.com/jobindj/obsidian-mkdocs)
