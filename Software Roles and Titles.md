I’ve noticed a lot of confusion in the industry about various software roles and titles, even among founders, hiring managers, and team builders. What are the various roles and responsibilities on a software team, and which job titles tend to cover which roles? %% highlight_id: 187436638 %%


Skills over titles %% highlight_id: 187436639 %%


Continuous delivery over deadlines %% highlight_id: 187436640 %%


Support over blame %% highlight_id: 187436641 %%


Collaboration over competition %% highlight_id: 187436642 %%


I like to reward initiative with increased responsibility, and if somebody has the skills and initiative to take on and outgrow the title they’re hired for, I like to promote rather than risk losing a rising star to another company or team. %% highlight_id: 187436643 %%
