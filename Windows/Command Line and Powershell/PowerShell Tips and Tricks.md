Get-ChildItem -Path $PWD | Sort-Object | Out-GridView

# sort the current directory by file length and view with GridView
Get-ChildItem -Path $PWD -File | Sort-Object -Property Length | Out-GridView

# list installed chocolatey,winget,pip,npm,etc. packages in GridView
choco list | Out-GridView
winget list | Out-GridView
pip list | Out-GridView
npm stars | Out-GridView
npm list | Out-GridView
```
