# Highlights 
2. Position yourself against the brand leader. Be brazen in the way you compare yourself to a leader in your field. Your story should be short, solid, and memorable. Can you be “cheaper than Frito’s” or “faster then Federal Express?” in your specific niche? The more your opponent gets publicized, the more your positioning statement increases in value.  ^64489423

1. Stop planning and start doing. Get out there and do it. The more you do, the more you do. Doors will open. Opportunities will appear. Your model will change, your reputation will increase, you will become a magnet for smart people. But none of this will happen if you stay inside and keep planning. Pick something on your list and just do it.  ^64489424

3. Be freakishly persistent. It’s not about what you know or even what you do. Success is about persistence. Set realistic expectations and don’t give up. Never take no for an answer but be respectfully persistent.  ^64489425
