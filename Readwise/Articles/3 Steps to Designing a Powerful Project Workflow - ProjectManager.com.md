# Highlights 
Start with the End in Mind
When you’re first thinking about a workflow, you want to start with the end in mind. That is, look towards the end goal and then work backwards, so you can figure out the right path to get there. This will help you determine your workflow process.  ^68332185

From this perspective, you’ll want to ask yourself some questions, such as: what are the processes, workflows and systems needed to reach the endpoint in the project, and what are the best practices to employ? You’ll want to create a checklist, and ask questions. Note who you’ll partner with, and decide what leadership team will drive the whole endeavor.  ^68332186

Here are three tips for defining a workflow for your project.

Create a realistic workflow diagram, and involve the people doing the work.
Get buy-in from the team, have them sign-off, and then adopt the plan for the project.
Match workflow process to a tool functionality so that the process drives the tool selection, and not the other way around.
The benefits of following this course are that it will improve your productivity, reduce errors as you’re working on the project, help relieve the stress and keep you consistent.  ^68332187

How to Optimize Your Workflow Process
Once you’ve defined your workflow, you’ll want to make it more efficient. One way to do this is through automation. It will help to streamline the internal workflow by getting rid of much of the manual data entry and request handling.  ^68332188

Analyze Your Workflow
By working to identify trends in the performance of your workflow, both in the teams and team members involved, you can tighten up the loose ends over time. One way to do that is by identifying the process redundancies and eliminating them. Software will help you analyze your processes as well.  ^68332189
