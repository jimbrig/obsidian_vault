Sub-Tasks on Microsoft To-Do  ^77275480

Officially called Steps, they allow you to add a series of to-do items under a single parent task.

You can use Steps in many ways. For example, they are useful if you want to control the workflow of a group of people who are all working on one project, but they also serve as bullet point reminders for you to jot down quick thoughts on a topic.  ^77275481

Microsoft To-Do Integration With Cortana  ^77275484

---

When you use Cortana with Microsoft To-Do, you will have the option to create your to-do lists and reminders directly on the app rather than in Cortana. Cortana can also read out your tasks in My Day and other lists you have made.  ^77275485

---

To use Cortana with the app, you need to set up Microsoft To-Do as a Connected Service. To do so, go to Cortana > Notebook > Manage Skills > Connected services on a PC or Cortana > Settings > Connected services. Select either Outlook or Office 365 (depending on whether youâ€™re using a personal of enterprise account), then hit the Connect button.  ^77275486

Flagged Emails in Outlook  ^77275487

Manage Your Day  ^77275488

---

If you use the app as a day-to-day task manager, you will probably find the My Day list to be one of its most useful features. In addition to flagged emails in Outlook appearing on the list, you can also add any other tasks onto it.

To add a to-do item to My Day, open the task in question (on desktop or mobile) and select Add to My Day.

The My Day list also offers suggestions on what you should add. On the desktop, go to the My Day list and click For Today in the upper right-hand corner. On mobile, open My Day and tap the icon at the bottom of the screen.

The suggestions are based on recently added tasks and tasks that have a due date of today. The app will not make suggestions for tasks which have reminders set for today.  ^77275489

Add Attachments to Tasks  ^77275490

See Your Week Ahead  ^77275491

---

A recent update brought a new smart list to the app: Planned.

The Planned section is split into two parts: Overdue and Later. Later shows any tasks in your calendar for the upcoming five days; Overdue displays tasks that you should have already completed but which have not yet been marked as such.

To turn on the smart lists, open the To-Do app on your desktop, then click on your profile picture and go to Settings > Smart Lists. Toggle the sliders next to the lists you want to enable.  ^77275492
