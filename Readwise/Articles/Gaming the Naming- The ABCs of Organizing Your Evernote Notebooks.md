# Highlights 
Notebook list is an Evernote app desktop setting that must be turned on in order to have your list display in the left side bar. If you aren't seeing your notebook list, go to [Mac] View > Sidebar Options > Show Notebook List or [PC] View > Left Panel > Show Notebooks to turn it on.  ^61946966

Notebooks appear in the left hand sidebar note list alphabetically according to the name of the notebook.  ^61946967

---

In the left side bar, stacks and non-stacked notebooks are co-mingled and sorted alphabetically together. A notebook doesn't have to be in a stack, but it can be [stacks are an optional user specific feature]. In other words, if you have created stacks, those stack names will sort alphabetically in line with any notebooks you have in your account that aren't in those stacks. Then, the notebooks that are in each stack will be sorted alphabetically within that stack.  ^61946968

Work isn't organized alphabetically. You want your notebooks/stacks [and your work that resides in them] organized in a way that has logic and meaning to you. My work is organized in a variety of ways: by status [active or archive], by business unit [Harmon Enterprises or Untethered with Evernote], and by client. Other common structures for organizing work include grouping by product, by vendor, by department or team member, and by phase. All are valid ways of organizing your work, but what they aren't is alphabetical.  ^61946969

A: the period punctuation mark (.) then

B: numbers to control the order of my primary notebooks and stacks on the left hand panel then

C: alphabetic characters to sort less important data that is not often referenced or part of my day-to-day system.  ^61946970

---

Regarding A: I like to use the period (.) because it is the tiniest and most subtle of the special characters.  ^61946971
