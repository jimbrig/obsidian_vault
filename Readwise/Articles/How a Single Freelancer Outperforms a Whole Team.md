Taking a break whenever you like and setting your own schedule is a pipedream in a team environment.

A freelancer is a sports sedan — reliable, responsive, and easy to work with. If a client wants to make a U-turn, all they gotta do is tell you; your tires immediately screech, and you’re headed in the client’s new direction.  ^119245365
