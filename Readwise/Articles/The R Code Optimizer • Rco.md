Using the R functions

Optimize some .R code files
optimize_files(c("file_to_optimize_1.R", "file_to_optimize_2.R"))
Optimize some code in a character vector
code <- paste(
  "code_to_optimize <- 8 ^ 8 * 1918",
  "cto <- code_to_optimize * 2",
  sep = "\n"
)
optimize_text(code)
Optimize all .R code files into a folder
optimize_folder("~/myfolder_to_optimize", recursive = FALSE)  ^64489420
