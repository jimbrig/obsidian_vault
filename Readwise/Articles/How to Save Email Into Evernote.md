Append an email to an existing note

To add some text to an existing note, put a " +" at the end of your subject line and we'll place the body of the email into the most recent note with that title.  ^61947471

Automatically file email into notebooks with related notes

By default, emails sent into Evernote go into your default notebook. If you frequently save emails into Evernote and organize them with similar notebooks and tags, you can enable auto-filing. When you forward an email into Evernote, auto-filing will look for similar notes inside your account and apply the same notebook and tags.

Enable auto-filing from your personal settings in Evernote Web.  ^61947472

Automatic email filtering or forwarding

You can also set up your email client's automatic email filters to automatically forward every email from a specific sender or with a particular subject.

For example, you can configure your email application to forward any emails sent from "Google Analytics' with "weekly report" in the subject line to your company's "Reports" notebook.  ^61947473

Auto-filing

You can let Evernote automatically organize your emailed in notes using our auto-filing feature. Once you enable auto-filing in your account settings, we'll check to see where you've placed similar content and how you've tagged it in the past. It's built using the same intelligent algorithms that power the smart filing feature in our Evernote Web Clipper. If you have auto-filing enabled, but want to put your notes into a specific location, simply specify a notebook and/or tag in the email subject. Using the notebook or tag names will override auto-filing for that note.  ^61947474
