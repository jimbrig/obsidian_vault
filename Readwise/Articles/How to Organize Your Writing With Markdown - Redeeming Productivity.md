# Highlights 
Begin Your Writing in Markdown

What Markdown adds to your plain-text writing is some simple syntax to indicate what different elements in your document are. For example, you can mark something as a level-one heading by using a hashtag. Level two headings begin with two hashtags and so forth. Bullet lists just need to begin with a hyphen or asterisk. To see all of the options check out this comprehensive Markdown cheatsheet.  ^115290470

Use a Markdown Editor to Organize

Since Markdown documents are plain-text you could just store them in folders on your computer. But I much prefer to use a Markdown editor to organize my documents.  ^115290471

I use Ulysses for this since I like its infinite folder structure. But there are tons of other Markdown editors which also have organizational abilities. And most of these sync across your devices. So, you can jot stuff down from your phone.

Drafts is a great lightweight option.
iA Writer works in Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android.
Bear is a beautiful option for the Apple ecosystem
And Caret is another good cross-platform option.
There are also lots of online Markdown editors like Dillinger. Or HackMD which allow you to work on Markdown documents collaboratively a la Google Docs.  ^115290472

Another benefit of organizing your writing this way is that your Markdown editor can act like a notebook, similar to how people use Evernote or Microsoft OneNote. For me, that means when I have an idea, I just open up Ulysses and start typing. And if I want to find an old written document, I know it’s somewhere in Ulysses. Using a Markdown editor keeps your writing organized and efficient.

So, now you’re writing your master documents in Markdown and you’re organizing them with a Markdown editor, but what do you do when it’s time to output that writing to a specific format and apply styling?  ^115290473
