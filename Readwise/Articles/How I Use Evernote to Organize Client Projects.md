# Highlights 
When I begin a new client project, I start an Evernote notebook for the project. This notebook becomes a digital hub for me to save everything** related to the project. I love having all this information in one spot and being able to access it no matter what device I’m using.  ^79544838

What goes in the project notebook?

Project documents — estimates, contracts, client questionnaire, project summary, etc
Emails — all emails from the client(s) are automatically forwarded to the project notebook
Research — potential Wordpress plugins, code examples, design inspiration, etc.
Notes — I try to be paperless, but I always take handwritten notes in meetings or on client calls. Using the Evernote iPhone app, I snap a photo of my handwritten notes and save it to the project notebook. Evernote’s search is so great that it searches through handwritten notes. Saving the image means I can easily look up my notes later on.
** I also have a Dropbox folder for each client project. Evernote is a way to easily access, view and search project content. Most files actually live in the Dropbox folder. I like having a copy of documents in Evernote for the search-ability. Tip: if you attach a file (such as a Word doc) to a note in Evernote, and update it outside of Evernote, it’s automatically updated in Evernote too.  ^79544841

2) Automatically send project emails to the notebook

When I start a new client project, I set up their emails to be automatically forwarded to my Evernote email address**. If you’re using Gmail go to Settings and the Filters and Blocked Address section to set up filters. Or, while viewing an email, click the More tab and select Filter Messages like these.  ^79544844

3) Using Notebooks as a Project Timeline

My Evernote system is influenced by Jamie Rubin’s Going Paperless series. Rubin talks about the concept of using Evernote as a timeline. Every note saved in Evernote automatically has a Created Date (similar to data associated with files on your computer).

“Everything I do (and want to remember) happens at some point in time. When it happens is always important to me. I, therefore, try to be very consistent about how I use the Create Date field on my notes in Evernote. The Create Date of a Note–for me–is the date on which the event occurred, not necessarily when the note was created.”

- Jamie Rubin

Knowing that every note in an Evernote notebook has a Created Date allows me to quickly scan a project and see if it’s on track. Did I schedule a project for six weeks, and it wound up taking 3 months? By scanning the dates of my notes, I can quickly see what project phases took longer than expected. This helps me evaluate the project and plan for future projects.  ^79544846
