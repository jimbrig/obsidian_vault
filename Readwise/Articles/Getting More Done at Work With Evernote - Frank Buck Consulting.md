# Highlights 
Once you determine your Life Categories, next comes the four tenets of your ongoing Getting More Done practice:

focus – different than mental attention, in this context, this is the decision to prioritize one routine over others to achieve mastery,
routine – habitual behaviors connected together,
accountability – finding the right type and amount of personal or social motivation, and
taking action – organizing the rest of your life around your routines.  ^61947811

In order to get more done, determine the single role or ongoing project that will be your focus for some period of time until you develop focus mastery.  ^61947812

---

Fitness is stretching your “work muscles” regularly. In GMD, each Fitness—physical, emotional, mental, sleep/rest, nutrition, social and rejuvenation—is a focus mastery project by itself.  ^61947813

I like to formalize these checklists in a digital tool (such as Evernote, Workflowy or Process Street) but you organize them however you deem fit.  ^61947814
