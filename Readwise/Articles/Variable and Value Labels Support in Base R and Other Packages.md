# Highlights 
Variable label is human readable description of the variable. R supports rather long variable names and these names can contain even spaces and punctuation but short variables names make coding easier. Variable label can give a nice, long description of variable. With this description it is easier to remember what those variable names refer to. Value labels are similar to variable labels, but value labels are descriptions of the values a variable can take. Labeling values means we donâ€™t have to remember if 1=Extremely poor and 7=Excellent or vice-versa. We can easily get dataset description and variables summary with info function.  ^63247048
