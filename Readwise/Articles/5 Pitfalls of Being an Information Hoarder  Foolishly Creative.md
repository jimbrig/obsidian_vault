# Highlights 
Do you know the difference between information and knowledge? Do you even understand that there even is a difference?  ^61947221

The purpose of this post is to not only draw a clear distinction between information and knowledge but to explain why hoarding too much information can be detrimental to getting your business started.  ^61947222

So how do you know if you’ve overloaded yourself with information? There are 5 tell-tale pitfalls:
You are too overwhelmed to effectively consume all of the information you’ve collected.
You’ve already forgotten about what you’ve already signed up for.
You didn’t find the information, it found you.
You’ve spent too much time researching and now you’ve compared yourself to others.
You are procrastinating. You are using your alleged lack of knowledge as an excuse.  ^61947224

How do you get back on track?
Sort through the information you’ve collected (and probably paid for). Categorize it and save it for when you need it.
Make a list of the skills you need right now. What’s the most effective way to obtain those skills? This will likely not be the cheapest.
Seek an expert/coach/mentor to help you identify the fastest way to do what you need to do.
Surf the internet (and social media) with caution. Beware of free downloads that you don’t need.
Unsubscribe from emails that aren’t useful.
Look through your book collection (can you sell or give some away)?
Look at your e-books. Can you organize and make time to read? Carve out time to read only what is useful in the present moment.
Realize that you are enough. There is someone that is waiting to be your client with the knowledge that you have now.  ^61947225

Remember, information is just data that has been defined, interpreted, and analyzed by someone else. Knowledge and experience are only gained by what you do with what you know. Ready to do something with your knowledge, life experience, and talents? If you have a business, you need a (better) website. Partner with me instead of spending time doing it yourself.  ^61947226
