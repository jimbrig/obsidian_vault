# Highlights 
Cloud Storage
Dropbox and OneDrive have official apps for Windows 10, and there’s also an unofficial Google Drive client you should check out.  ^69770719

OneDrive is Microsoft’s flagship cloud storage service. For people who don’t want to deal with the somewhat fiddly desktop folder, the app is a great alternative.  ^69770720

**Note: try out the store app!**

Copying and pasting are incredibly useful and simple. If you have to move a lot of content, however, constantly bouncing back and forth between apps can quickly become frustrating.

Try using Copy Space instead. It’s a universal clipboard that can store several items at once. All your copies are sorted into categories, and it can sync between all your devices.  ^69770721

---

Overdrive has a global network of more than 34,000 libraries which you can use to borrow eBooks, audiobooks, and videos.

Anything you borrow will automatically sync across all your devices and the library is open 24/7. The app also doubles as an eReader, so you can do your borrowing and reading through the same interface.

Best of all titles are automatically returned at the end of their loan period—you’ll never have to pay a late fee again!

(Note: You need to be a member of your local library to access the app)  ^69770722

Using this Amazon Windows 10 app is faster than using the website. Search is fast and processing purchases is efficient—try it!  ^69770723

We’ve all lived in a place with a dodgy internet connection at some point in our lives. Perhaps the speed fluctuates wildly or your connection is prone to dropping out. Sadly, internet service providers rarely have much inclination to do anything about it—they’re getting your money and they’re happy.

It’s frustrating to try and build up a body of evidence to present to them. Speed test websites are full of adverts and they don’t log your historical results.

Network Speed Test rectifies the problem. It’s got a clean interface, it’s lightning fast, and it logs past network performance history in easy-to-understand charts.  ^69770724
