10 Tools to Help You Implement Systems

You don’t have to make the next all-encompassing personal productivity system. Take something that’s already been built and apply it to your own life.

Here are some frameworks and tools you can work from:

Every day write down your Most Important Tasks
Setup a Morning Routine
Put every appointment into your calendar app
Inbox Zero your email
Automate your bills
Plan your meals for the week, and when you’re going to cook them
Plan your life on different time scales (Daily, Weekly, Quarterly, 25 years)
Organize your research in a Notetaking App
Setup a Task Planning system– GTD / ZTD / The Agile Way  ^61947326

---

Pick one of these and implement it. Don’t look for the holy grail of systems, pick something simple that works. Your system doesn’t need to be perfect, or cover every edge case. Improve on it later if you need to.  ^61947327
