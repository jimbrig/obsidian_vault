Add a new task from anywhere within the Todoist app by pressing q  ^61947133

To add tasks to the bottom of a list, press a  ^61947134

To add a new task to the top of a list, use Shift + A. (Note: These two shortcuts will only work inside a project view.)  ^61947135

---

While you’re editing a task, you can change the indentation of the task by pressing Ctrl + Alt + → (Windows legacy app), Alt + Shift + → (Windows 10) or ⌘ + Option + → (Mac). If you indent a task, it becomes the sub-task of the task above it which can be highly useful for breaking down large to-dos into multi-step tasks.  ^61947136

---

The desktop apps also have a universal shortcut you can use whenever the Todoist app is open. Just press Shift + Command + A (Mac) or Ctrl + Alt + A (Windows legacy app) to open the Quick Add. (Unfortunately, Windows 10 doesn’t support global shortcuts.)  ^61947137

Dictate tasks to Todoist  ^61947138

If you use an iPhone or iPad, all you have to do is ask Siri to add a task — and even set a due date — in Todoist. For example, say “Hey Siri, add a task to start drafting the blog post tomorrow in Todoist”.  ^61947139

Add tasks from your email inbox  ^61947146

Email is one of the biggest sources of stress in the modern workplace, but Todoist’s plug-ins for Todoist widget to the Today tab in your Notification Center and Outlook can help you keep your digital correspondence wrangled and your inbox clean and organized. Easily add your emails as tasks in Todoist with specific due dates to remind you to respond or follow up. If you tend to check your email on your phone, there are also several 3rd-party app integrations that let you accomplish the same thing.

Last month, the Todoist team published a full, updated guide on how to reach and stay at Inbox Zero with Todoist.  ^61947147

Add whole groups of tasks using templates  ^61947148

---

Checklists save lives! And stress. And embarrassment. Create your own for recurring projects to make sure nothing falls through the cracks.  ^61947149

---

For example, every time I’m planning a new blog post, video or podcast, I always need the same set of tasks. I can’t set these up as recurring tasks because my project schedule fluctuates from week to week.

Templates come to the rescue. I can simply import a template full of pre-organized tasks each time a video or podcast is coming up. This way, I don’t have to sit down and type out each individual task every single time I need to work on a new project.

You can create a template from any existing project, or just create a new project, fill it with your required tasks and use that one, instead. Exporting a project as a template and importing it into a new project is a simple process, and you can repeat it as often as necessary.

Tip: Bookmark the template import link to load a new template with just a click.  ^61947150

Automatically create tasks using IFTTT or Zapier  ^61947151

---

Automatically add your most important emails as tasks in Todoist  ^61947152

---

I use Pocket to keep track of my reading. I’ve set up my own integration so that whenever I add a link to my Pocket, a Todoist task is created in my Reading project to remind me to come back to the article. Check out the applet (that’s what IFTTT calls its custom integrations). You can also prevent flooding your Todoist by only adding tasks from Pocket articles that have a specific tag, like mustread.  ^61947153

---

Add articles from Pocket to your reading list in Todoist.
If you’re using a Google spreadsheet to keep track of a list, use this Zap to make every new row create a new task in Todoist. This could be useful for tasks as varied as grocery lists, expenses, and PR outreach.  ^61947154

---

If I miss a phone call, a new task reminds me to return the call later.  ^61947155

---

Automatically keep track of missed phone calls.  ^61947156

---

Even tomorrow’s weather can automatically create a new task in Todoist.  ^61947157

---

With so many options available to add new tasks, it’s easy to declutter your brain and keep track of everything in Todoist no matter where you are or what devices you use. Once you’ve built a habit of saving your tasks to Todoist, you can be confident that everything’s organized and accounted for so you can focus on just the task at hand and come back to the rest of it later. Organizational zen.  ^61947158
