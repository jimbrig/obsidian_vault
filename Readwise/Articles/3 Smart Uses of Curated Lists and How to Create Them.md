# Highlights 
A curated list is a list on a certain topic that has been compiled carefully, usually by research and by a creator of the included content.

Having content curated makes it much easier for users to find online, instead of searching through all the available web pages. Curated lists allow for users to discover a list of curated information and find the answers they need all in one helpful place.  ^78903542

Curated Lists vs. RSS  ^78903543

---

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is another useful component to curated lists, as RSS allows users to access updates to online content such as content in curated lists.  ^78903544

The difference with RSS is that it is fast fetching content, and then making it available daily or instantly. This makes it ideal for indexing content that is quick to consume.

On the other hand, a curated list takes time to build and grow and can be added to over time. This makes it especially useful for organizing in-depth content that can be used as reference.  ^78903545
