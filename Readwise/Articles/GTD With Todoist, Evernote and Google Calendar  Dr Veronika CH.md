# Highlights 
The goals of the system are to

keep me focused on important projects, but not forget everything else
give me insight into how much I‚Äôve already done
not overschedule my time / say no more often
not get overwhelmed by everything that needs to be done
eliminate decisions on what to do next  ^61947159

---

Rather than the five steps of GTD, I see my system as just two steps: capture and organize.  ^61947160

---

Capture everything
I have never really had problems with forgetting to do something I promised, failing to start a project on time, or missing a deadline. So when I read GTD, the ‚Äúcapture everything‚Äù idea seemed a bit unnecessary. But it has been a life changer!

My rule is: as soon as I think of something I (might) need or want to do in the future, no matter how vague it is, I have to capture it in Todoist or Evernote immediately. I tend to use Todoist for actions I‚Äôm quite sure I will do, like:

send a reminder to a collaborator
upload my recent paper to arXiV
buy printer paper  ^61947161

---

Evernote, on the other hand, is for ideas and ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù actions:

idea for a project around the house
an article I want to read
a piece of advice I want to remember  ^61947162

---

The most important thing, however, is to just choose one of the two and not spend too long thinking about it. The capturing must happen as soon as possible, so I tend to only add a keyword or two, and then organize later  ^61947163

---

Quick access widgets on my phone  ^61947164

---

Both Todoist and Evernote have awesome widgets for your phone  ^61947165

---

I use these widgets extensively when I‚Äôm walking somewhere, doing things around the house, and in conversations where I wouldn‚Äôt normally be taking notes. For example, I‚Äôve started doing this with all sorts of recommendations from others, for example for podcasts. In work meetings I actually tend to use pen and paper because I write faster and I don‚Äôt want to use my phone the whole time. Then I transfer everything into Todoist/Evernote as soon as I‚Äôm in my office again.  ^61947166

Todoist plugin for Gmail  ^61947167

---

A trap that‚Äôs easy to fall into is to let your email dictate your day. Most emails have some todos associated with them, and it‚Äôs tempting to handle these first, before starting ‚Äúreal work‚Äù. Not anymore with Todoist plugin for Gmail. This plugin adds a button which lets you create a todo from an email. I do this for two types of emails ‚Äì emails that will need time to respond to, and emails I need to follow up on.

As an example of emails that need time to respond to, I‚Äôm using a reminder email to complete my reviews for a conference (I had returned the reviews already at that point). Since I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be able to do this when I received the email, I would create a todo out of it by clicking the Todoist button (right of the Labels button).

This opens up a Todoist window, which already has the email‚Äôs subject (as description) filled in, and possibly dates that might be involved.  ^61947168

---

The subject is automatically used as a description  ^61947169

---

Once I add the todo, I archive the email!  ^61947170

---

This archiving was scary at first, but this goes away with time.  ^61947171

---

Another way I use this plugin is for emails I need to follow-up on  ^61947172

---

Then I add it to Todoist with a ‚ÄúSend reminder about X‚Äù description, and a date at which the reminder feels appropriate.  ^61947173

---

This part of the system isn‚Äôt as smooth, since it can only be done on existing emails. If you are sending the first email of a thread, you will have to go to ‚ÄúSent‚Äù and add the email to Todoist from there. Another issue is what to do after an unsuccessful reminder. Now I just reschedule the todo, so I can send another reminder later, but it‚Äôs not an accurate reflection of what I actually did. Any ideas on how to handle this are welcome!  ^61947174

---

Email forwarding to Evernote
If an email contains some information I might want to use, but I‚Äôm not sure exactly when I will need it, I forward it to Evernote. Some examples:

Procedures on how to do something, e.g. filling in reimbursement forms
Newsletters with great content which I might want to use as inspiration someday
Happy emails, e.g. ‚Äúthank you‚Äù emails or papers getting accepted.  ^61947175

---

Share to Evernote  ^61947176

---

Evernote offers more ways to save to it, such as the Evernote Web Clipper for Chrome desktop, and ‚ÄúShare via‚Äù option that many Android apps have, and where Evernote comes up as an option if you have it installed. Some examples:

A website I like the layout or structure of and want to use as inspiration
A website of a person I might want to contact
An article I might want to read
An article I already read, but want to share with others
A Twitter thread with good advice or opinions
Opening times of a store I always forget the name of
A picture of an item I might want to buy
A picture of an event poster, that I might want to attend  ^61947177

---

Perhaps I should mention here that another rule I have for capturing is that I HAVE to use Todoist or Evernote. Not ‚Äúleave it on the table where I will see it‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just write it down over here‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just add it to my favorites‚Äù. This part isn‚Äôt always perfect, but I‚Äôm improving, and writing this post actually helped me identify problem areas (leaving things on the table). Thanks! üôÇ  ^61947178
