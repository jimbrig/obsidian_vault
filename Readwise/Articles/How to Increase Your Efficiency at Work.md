# Highlights 
It’s amazing how much a short walk every 90 minutes or so can improve our efficiency at work. It refreshes our eyes, our mind, and our body all at once.  ^124785255

“Don’t wish it were easier, wish you were better” are wise words that Jim Rohn used to mention in all his lectures and a quote. It's something that everyone should take into consideration when thinking of ways to increase efficiency at work. The more experience and knowledge we acquire, the easier tasks become, which is why we should always work on improving our own ability.  ^124785256

Busywork Sucks
Most people aren’t lazy. The problem is they don’t want to do what they should. Instead, they fill much of their day doing activities that give them a sense of accomplishment while never making any real progress on the things they should.  ^124785257

Time Tracking
One of the big mistakes people make is they think they are good at managing their time, yet have never taken the time to really analyze just how they are using their time.
With clients, one of the first things I have them do is do a time audit. I want to know just how much time they spend and where. It’s often eye-opening for clients when they do this. No matter how good we think we are at using our time, we can always be better.  ^124785258

Efficiency’s Magic Number Is One
A single-minded focus on a task will transform your productivity like no other. Unfortunately, most of us don’t realize just how unaccustomed we are to this and think that multi-tasking is the key to getting things done. Wrong! It’s precisely the opposite. Multitasking prevents us from reaching concentrated focus and our efficiency at work suffers from it.  ^124785259

Notifications Are a Dime a Dozen
Please, if you aren’t a surgeon who needs to be on call because it’s a life and death situation, turn off your notifications. We get distracted, on average, every 4 minutes. Those distractions are absolutely productivity killers as they take us away from our train of thought.  ^124785260

The Bottom Line
Increasing your efficiency at work isn't rock science. In fact, it's downright simple. It's the simplicity that trips people up. Too often people look for new shiny toys when the answers are right in front of them. These concepts transformed my life and those of many entrepreneurs the world over and you'd be foolish not to at least give them a fair shake.
Remember, like all concepts, applying them once and expecting big results just won't happen. But over time, simple concepts done repeatedly can achieve incredible results.  ^124785261
