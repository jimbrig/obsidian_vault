# Highlights 
Suppose that you want to export all your Evernote data to Google Drive in a way that you can view them as you did in Evernote - a text file note would just be a text file, a PDF would just be a PDF, and a jpg would just be a jpg. In this situation, you need to migrate Evernote to Google Drive, and MultCloud is helpful.  ^63109543
