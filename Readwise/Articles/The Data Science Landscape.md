# Highlights 
Fourth, over- and underfitting of the model should be avoided as underfitting leads to generally poor performance and high prediction error while overfitting leads to poor generalization and high model complexity. Lastly, the result of the data science project must be communicated in a way that non-technical people can understand. A suitable way to communicate data is to use visualization techniques. In the business context, a good reference for presenting data is the International Business Communication Standards (IBCS).  ^115127931

First, at the initial stage, it is paramount that the underlying business problem is clear to all stakeholders involved. Second, sufficient time has to be allocated for the data preparation stage which typically accounts for the majority of time spent during most projects. Third, the right variables have to be selected by the data scientist. A model should ideally comprise only the fewest possible number of variables with relevant explanatory power. The process of feature selection is therefore important in order to maximize performance while reducing the noise in a model.  ^115127932

The Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model with six phases that naturally describes the data science life cycle. It is a framework to plan, organize and implement a data science project.  ^115127940

The R programming language, for example, was built primarily for statistical applications. Therefore, it is highly suitable for statistical tasks as well as visualization using the popular R package ggplot2.  ^115127942

The most popular languages for machine learning are Python, C/C++, Java, R and Java Script.  ^115127943

Analytics generates insights from data using simple presentation, manipulation, calculation or visualization of data. In the context of data science, it is also sometimes referred to as exploratory data analytics. It often serves the purpose to familiarize oneself with the subject matter and to obtain some initial hints for further analysis. To this end, analytics is often used to formulate appropriate questions for a data science project.  ^115127945
