# Highlights 
I have customized this format to my needs, I have the following lists:

Personal
Work
Someday / Maybe
List per big project I have (either personal or work related)  ^62472772

On top of these lists I have several tags according to where I’m suppose to do them:

@Office
@Call
@Errands (i.e. by groceries)
@Internet
@Email
@Home
@Blog
Each task can have additional tag

na (Next Actions) – the task is not dependant on other task to complete.
