# Highlights 
I’ve noticed a lot of confusion in the industry about various software roles and titles, even among founders, hiring managers, and team builders. What are the various roles and responsibilities on a software team, and which job titles tend to cover which roles?  ^187436638

Skills over titles  ^187436639

Continuous delivery over deadlines  ^187436640

Support over blame  ^187436641

Collaboration over competition  ^187436642

I like to reward initiative with increased responsibility, and if somebody has the skills and initiative to take on and outgrow the title they’re hired for, I like to promote rather than risk losing a rising star to another company or team.  ^187436643
