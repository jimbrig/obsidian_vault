# Highlights 
Making a Plan
The first step to project management is making a plan and getting buy-in from all relevant stakeholders, including target piees of work to deliver on different timelines. projmgr allows you to easily articulate a project plan in human-readable YAML and then seamlessly bulk-upload a set of GitHub issues and milestones.  ^76712490
