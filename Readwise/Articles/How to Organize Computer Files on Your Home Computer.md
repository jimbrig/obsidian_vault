# Highlights 
For an organized computer file system I recommend that you do not keep files anywhere but within your documents folder.  ^67490476

---

Work folder - If you work on documents or files for work, you should separate out these files into their own separate area instead of getting them mized up with your personal files.  ^67490477

---

Financial folder: Banking documents - Many banks encourage their customers to go paperless these days. If you've signed up for paperless banking it is still a good idea to download your bank statements and other documents from the bank regularly, especially if your bank only provides digital records back for a certain period, like 6 months or a year. Before they aren't available anymore, make sure to download a copy so you can access it later, if you need it.  ^67490478

---

Financial folder: Credit card statements (or other loan documents). Organize these folders to have sub-folders for each credit credit separately, organized by date ranges.  ^67490480

---

Financial folder: Tax documents - These tax documents may include digital copies of the filed tax returns themselves, or back up documentation needed for your tax return filings, such as receipts or other records. You should organize these folders and sub-folders by year, and by the type of document, in a similar method as you would when organizing the folders in your tax organizer.  ^67490482

---

Financial folder: Bills - If you have signed up for online bill payment you may get your bills as digital files, such as a PDF, instead of on paper. You should create a sub-folder for each type of bill for each year, so it's easy to keep them together and organized, and then to delete old bills once a couple of years has passed and they're no longer relevant. (You can get more ideas for organizing bills here. In addition, if your bills are sent via email, you may want to organize them in your email system instead of in your computer files. You can get more information about organizing email folders here.)  ^67490484

---

Home inventory - I recommend everyone create a home inventory in case of theft or natural disaster, and keep a digital copy of that inventory. You can read more about how to create a home inventory here.  ^67490486

PDFs, including ebooks - Many of us love to receive books and other information in the form of ebooks or PDFs. This frees us from accumulating too much physical book clutter, but we've still got to keep these documents organized. If you've only got a few informational PDFs or ebooks you can have a general folder to keep them in, being sure to name each PDF or ebook file yourself in a way that you know what it is, and why you were interested in it. However, if you accumulate a lot of ebooks or PDFs, such as if you love to get bundles of these products (like I do!) you should categorize the ebooks and PDFs into sub-folders of their own categories, such as cleaning ebooks, meal planning ebooks, or recipe ebooks, so you can find the type of information you want more easily.  ^67490488
