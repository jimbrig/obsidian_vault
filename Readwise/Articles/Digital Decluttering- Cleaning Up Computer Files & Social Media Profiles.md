# Highlights 
Digital Decluttering: Files & folders  ^94641482

---

I went into Documents and moved all the files out of their folders. This took some time but I needed to have everything in one big pile. I looked through each one in turn and decided whether or not it sparked joy. If it didn’t, it was deleted. (Remember that utility, convenience and necessity are forms of joy.)  ^94641483

Once that was done, I arranged them into groups, like with like. If there was already a folder there that covered the topic, I transferred them all into that. If not, I created a new folder. If sub-folders were necessary (eg. taxes divided by year) I did that, but only if I had enough files (3 minimum) to warrant another folder. Afterwards, empty folders were deleted.  ^94641484

Top tip: Open each file briefly to ensure the contents match up with the file name. Re-name anything ambiguous or confusing into something more easily recognisable.  ^94641485

Digital Decluttering: Bookmarks  ^94641486

---

Same process here — I eliminated everything I knew was no longer of interest to me, including a lot of wedding inspiration sites (I’m married 4 years now) or products I no longer wish to purchase (hurray KonMari Method).

Thereafter, I went through each one individually. If it was just a blog post, individual product page, or similar, I left it open. If it was a site that I genuinely visit on any sort of regular basis, I left it where it was, re-naming it if necessary.

Of the ones that were left open, I sat down and went through all of them. I was able to eliminate a lot straight off the bat. If there was an article that was particularly interesting but I’d probably only reference once or twice more, I saved it to Pocket, which is like an online folder for websites. (You could also use Evernote, Instapaper, etc.) If I thought I’d come back to it more regularly, I left it as a bookmark.

Top tip: Visit all the sites, even if you think you know exactly what they are. I had a few that turned out to be no longer available or that re-directed to an unrelated page.  ^94641487
