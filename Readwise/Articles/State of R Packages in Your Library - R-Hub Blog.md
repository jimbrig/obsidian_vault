# Highlights 
Where do installed packages live?
Packages are installed

at the path you give as lib argument to install.packages() (or to any remotes::install_ function, that will pass them on to install.packages());

most often since you wonâ€™t give any, at the first path returned by .libPaths() that exists and for which the user has the right permissions.  ^83464320

Now at library loading, the important argument is called lib.loc, not lib.  ^83464321

As an user installing packages, you need to look into the keep.source.pkgs option in options() that influences the behavior of package installation, or for a specific package youâ€™d write install.packages("rhub", INSTALL_opts = "--with-keep.source", type = "source"). If you use Windows or Mac and donâ€™t write type = "source", binaries might be use in which case the keep.source.pkgs option is ignored.

As a developer working interactively on a package (with e.g. devtools::load_all()), you need to make sure the source is kept as is when loading the package, and when loading it (lucky you, the relevant keep.source option is TRUE by default in interactive sessions ðŸŽ‰).  ^83464322

As a developer you might also encounter the case where R CMD check will tell you about another switch, in an environment variable. It is a switch related to package installation, since R CMD check will install your package for checking it . See the lines below from the R source mirror:  ^83464323
