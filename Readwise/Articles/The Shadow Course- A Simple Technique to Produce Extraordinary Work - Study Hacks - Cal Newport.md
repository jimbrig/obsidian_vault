# Highlights 
The autopilot schedule is a set of fixed times and locations for finishing your regular work each week. For example, you might decide to always tackle your history reading assignments Monday morning, from 9 am to 11 am, in the study carrels found on the 6th floor stacks of the main library.

To make things even better, because this time is spread out across an autopilot schedule, these hours all maintain a high intensity of focus â€” a feat which would be impossible if this time was condensed into a small number of long study session.  ^70488923
