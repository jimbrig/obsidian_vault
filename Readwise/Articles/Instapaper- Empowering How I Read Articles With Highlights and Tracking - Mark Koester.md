# Highlights 
Personally, anything I’m going to spend the time reading online gets saved into Instapaper.  ^61947256

While I may not always read it in the app, I do my best to save and archive what I read once a day. This means nearly every important article I read online is captured and tracked. That way I have a decent record and count of my reading habits. We will look more at the tracking part shortly.  ^61947257

---

All of my highlights then get saved for me to use and reference later.  ^61947258

---

I have researched and tried some of these tools, like Liner, but never found the experience very good across devices and systems.  ^61947259

---

The other nice thing about Instapaper is Search.  ^61947260

These are the core features I use with Instapaper. Worth mentioning if you are curious on other features are:

Folders: These are specific areas that allow you to save articles to for later and provide more organization.
Browse: This is Instapaper aggregator of great material found online. It is mostly a best of space.  ^61947261

---

Speed Reading: This is a premium feature that will display articles word by word in high speed and can increase how fast you read. I’ve tried similar approaches in the past but never been a huge fan of reading like this.  ^61947262

Tracking Your Article Reading and Highlights with IFTTT and QS Ledger  ^61947263

---

Instapaper and IFTTT have a really great integration that makes it possible to keep a log of every article you save, read and like.  ^61947264

---

You can also use it to save your highlights too.  ^61947265

---

IFTTT works great, but what if you don’t want to use a third-party tool or you already have saved articles in Instapaper?

In that case, the best approach is pulling your history directly from the Instapaper API. Instapaper’s API is quite well documented and easy to use.  ^61947266

QS Ledger (short for Quantified Self Ledger) is an assortment tools for data collection and data visualization. It’s written and developed in python code using Jupyter Notebooks and currently aggregates and processes data from nearly 20 sources, including Fitbit, Apple Health, Google, RescueTime and many others. It can provide a starting point to analyze and visualize a life in personal data.  ^61947267

---

t can be used to understand how you sleep, your exercise behavior, or how much time you spend on the computer or listening to music. It can also be used to pull data on what articles you read from both Pocket and Instapaper. Each project and integration includes a data downloader and data analysis notebook.  ^61947268

---

After you’ve got your data, I recommend you checkout the Instapaper data analysis notebook which provides a good way to look at your reading history.  ^61947269
