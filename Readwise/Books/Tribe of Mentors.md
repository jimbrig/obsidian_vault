# Highlights 
When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do?

My best friend put a little quote in my birthday card a few years ago: 
“When makes a river so restful to people is that it doesn't have any doubt- it is sure to get where it is going, and it doesn't want to go anywhere else." – Hal Bovle 

There is so much going on in a day, actions and distractions, it's easy to get caught up and lose your vision. This quote brings me right back to where I want to be. It keeps me grounded. ([184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071KJ7PTB&location=184)) ^75830202

If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it say and why?

Simple one for me to answer: 

“Storms make us stronger." 

If I had one mes for young people embarking on life, it would be this. Don't shy away from the hard times. Tackle them head-on, move toward the path less trodden, riddled with obstacles, because most other people run at the first sign of battle, The storms give us a chance to define ourselves, to distinguish ourselves, and we always emerge from them stronger.

Greg: 

First, I yell "FUCK!" as loud as I can! Then, I compartmentalize and DIN and DIP ("do it now" and "do it proper"). ([285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071KJ7PTB&location=285)) ^75852851
