# Highlights 
My blog became my R&D lab: a place to ramble, rant, play, test, dissect, entertain, summarize, explain, argue, advocate, theorize, and generally way overthink all the ideas I was encountering in my work and my life.

I was writing for me. ([57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=57)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947376

You see, I have to write to know what I think. All my ideas sound brilliant in the echo chamber of my own mind. It is only when I put down my thoughts, letting them stand on their own strength, that I start to see the cracks and imperfections.

It actually goes beyond this – I have to write to think. Otherwise the same old ideas keep circulating round and round, clogging the synapses. Writing is not a result of thinking – it is thinking itself, scaffolded by the external props of a keyboard and ([60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=60)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947378

The title Design Your Work refers to the overall theme tying together these essays: the idea that one can design their own work. ([72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=72)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947380

You don’t have to adopt the same productivity methods as everyone else. You can adapt, tweak, customize, and reframe any aspect of how you work, from how you process emails to how you organize information to how you structure your attention to how you measure your performance.

What exactly are the conditions required for high-performance creativity, and how can we use Evernote (or other note-taking programs) to create these conditions? ([1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=1165)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947382

creativity is connecting things, especially things that don’t seem to be connected. ([1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=1169)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947383

Evernote’s ability to capture an extremely diverse range of media formats is a strong hint that this is what it should be used for. It prioritizes this kind of flexibility over speed (it’s not the fastest program around), collaboration (which it doesn’t support very well), and even stability (some features are buggy).

Research on cognition has shown that our basic mode of thinking is not abstract reasoning and planning, but “interacting via perception and action with the environmental situation.” ([1189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=1189)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947387

Essentially, it’s easier for us to interact with physical objects in the environment than with abstract ideas in our heads. ([1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=1192)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947388
