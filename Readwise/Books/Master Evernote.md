If you’re using Evernote to manage projects, you can create a to-do list, print it out and easily check off all the tasks that need to be completed. You can also maintain this list on your smartphone and cross off each item as you work through a project. Using this feature is a great way to stay on top of important tasks. ([467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=467)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947330

Tip 2. Take many notes. The 25MB maximum size is a very large file, so you might be tempted to create huge notes with a lot of extraneous information. While this could work, I recommend taking lots of notes instead of dumping a ton of information into just a few notes. ([470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=470)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947331

Tip 3: Get an Alarm email. The “Alarm” feature will send you an email for a specific, pre-determined action. This is a great way to set a reminder for an important task or appointment. ([481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=481)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947332

I recommend maintaining a separate notebook of ideas and spur-of-the-moment thoughts. This might include a combination of written notes, audio updates and context-specific photos. My recommendation is to add to this notebook during the week. Then go through each item once a week during a review session. Explore each thought and decide if it’s immediately actionable. If it is, then create a quick project list and schedule specific action items. If it isn’t, then schedule a reminder to follow up on it at a later date. Finally, remove each note and file it in a long-term storage notebook called “Tickler File” or “Previous Ideas.” ([569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=569)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947337

Random Notebook: Your Evernote program might be filled with random notes because you don’t have time to sort them. It’s okay put them in a temporary ([575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=575)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947338

“Random” notebook until you have time to review them. The Tag feature makes it easy to find any note—even if it’s in a disorganized pile of information. ([576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=576)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947339

Tagging Practice 1: Stick to a Standard Tagging Convention ([679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=679)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947340

---

Tagging Practice 2: Uses Plurals Instead of Singular Tags Use the plural version of a word instead of its singular version. This makes it easier to find notes when you search for them. If you type “picture” and the tag is “pictures,” the note will show up since partial matches count. However, if I type “pictures” and the tag is “picture,” the note won’t show up because Evernote doesn’t consider it to be the same word. Do your best to be uniform with tagging. The good news is if you get this right for a few weeks, most of the tags you add will already be there when you need to tag a new note.

---

Tagging Practice 4: Keep Tags Streamlined  The beauty of tagging is there isn’t a realistic limit to how many you can have. Unfortunately, that’s also the danger of tagging. Honestly, who really needs 100,000 tags?  Evernote can become very clunky if you have to sort through thousands of tags at the same time. My point? Although you don’t have to worry about reaching a hard limit, you shouldn’t create a unique ([695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=695)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947343

---

Tagging Practice 5: Start Broad, Then Narrow Your Focus I like to start a note entry with a generic tag. These tags work great when they correspond to specific stacks or notebooks. For instance, you could create tags like Recipes, Travel, Health, or Home Improvement. Then you should create additional tags that drill down into the specifics of the content. So, using the previous example, you could add to the Health tag using additional modifiers such as Running, Lifting and Stretching.

A great way to create effective tags is to use the 5 W questions we all learned in school. Let’s discuss a concrete example here. If I tagged a photo of myself and four friends at the beach in Belmar, New Jersey, then my tags might look like this: #belmar #newjersey #george #klaus #wilhelm #rebecca #2014 #pictures #sunset. The point behind this tagging convention is to make it easy to quickly find related notes in the future. In 2024, it will be easy to locate the right images if I want to find pictures of Klaus in Belmar.

One of the big differences between “classic GTD” and “Evernote GTD” are the tools involved. In his book, David Allen recommends a number of tools: • Paper holding trays • Paperclips • Binding clips • Stapler • Rubber bands • Tape • Calendar • File folders ([1214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=1214)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947348

---

File cabinets • Labeler • Pen/pencil As you can see, these tools may be essential for “real-world” application of GTD, but you don't need any of them if you use Evernote for GTD. The purpose of each item is processing massive amounts of paperwork, but since you’re putting most items into Evernote, you don’t need to worry that much about a paper-based workflow. ([1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=1221)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947349

#5. Create a project list: Multi-step projects don’t always have a clear-cut “next action” from the very beginning. You need to create a plan and then develop a list of tasks to incorporate into your workflow. ([1261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=1261)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947350

---

Idea #12: Create Extensive Outlines Outlining isn’t something you just do in school. In fact, any creative project could benefit from doing an extensive outline. Every time you start a new project, create a new notebook for your ideas. Use this notebook to store project-related links, tools and thoughts. The more you add to this notebook, the better the outcome of your project. ([1462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=1462)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947351

---

Idea #21: Map Out Project Lists Creating actionable lists is the key to completing any project. Each list item should be a specific task with a measurable outcome. For example, "Lose five pounds by July 30" is better than "lose weight" because it is more specific. With Evernote, you can create a note for each project and use a checkbox to-do list. As you complete one task, look at the following item on the list to see what you need to do next. Add these project lists to a notebook titled “Action Folder,” and you’ll have a central location for the tasks you need to complete in the near future. ([1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=1503)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947352

---

Idea #22: Create a Weekly Action List A weekly action list takes the concept of the project list one step further. At the start of the week (I prefer Sundays), go through each of your project lists and identify the most important items for your personal and professional life. Instead of having to rely on multiple project lists, you’ll have a small collection of tasks that will be the focus for the next seven days. Get started by creating a simple checklist within a note. Put this note in a notebook called “!Weekly” so it shows up near the top of your Evernote dashboard. Then open this list on a daily basis to see what tasks you need to complete. ([1509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=1509)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947353

---

Idea #23: Create Process Checklists  Process checklists are a little different than project lists because they describe the step-by-step actions of a regular process. The benefit of writing everything down is you either identify ways to improve ([1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=1515)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947354

Idea #24: Organize Your Research Whether you’re in school or own your own business, it’s important to make research and continued self-education an important part of your day. The good news? Evernote makes it easy to put every link, chart, PDF, article and excerpt into a central location that’s easy to search on multiple devices. Overall, this tool is a big improvement over the browser full of bookmarks you thought were important. This also beats the pants off of frantically ([1522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=1522)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947355

Idea #25: Record Business Meetings Make audio recordings of important meetings and save them to Evernote. This frees you up your time so you never miss an important task. You can also have these notes transcribed or use them to assign projects to specific members of your team. This idea can also minimize future legal problems. For instance, if you operate an LLC with another person, it’s important to keep minutes of each meeting because it shows you’re functioning as a legitimate business instead of as a personal entity. This can be important if you ever get sued and a lawyer is trying to go after your personal assets.

Idea #28: Declutter Your Inbox Anyone who has an interest in time management understands the danger of an out-of-control email inbox. Fortunately, there’s a lot you can do with Evernote to stem the tide. • Forward your email to Evernote and manage everything in one central location. • Create a “Delegate” Notebook for identifying recurring requests someone else can handle. • Create an “Eliminate” Notebook of recurring messages that truly aren’t important. Find a way to get rid of them. • Use free time to write down “template responses” for common requests. Out-of-control email is the bane of existence for many people. To get better at managing email, you need to practice the daily habit of identifying different areas to streamline.

Idea #54: Keep a Reference List This is great idea for errands and shopping trips. Create a list of favorite brands, clothing sizes and products your family members use. This is useful if you want to surprise someone important with a gift (such as a new shirt) and you can’t quite remember their measurements or preferences. Keep adding notes to this list and you’ll quickly build a database of everything that’s important.

Idea #58: Journal Your Thoughts

Many people use daily journaling as a way to reduce stress and bring order to a hectic lifestyle. You can gain clarity on your day-to-day activities by writing down responses to a few basic questions:

• What are you grateful for?
• What would make today great?
• What interesting things happened to you today?

The questions themselves aren’t that important. What’s important is creating a simple template you use on a daily basis. This template should act as a prompt for your journaling habit. Do some journaling for a few minutes every day to gain more perspective on what’s truly important in your life. ([1720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=1720)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947360

**Note: Do some journaling for a few minutes every day to gain more perspective on what’s truly important in your life.**

Idea #74: Track Quarterly (or Yearly) Goals Goal setting has been proven to be a critical part of personal success. When you write down actionable goals and review them daily, you increase your chances of actually achieving them. A great way to use Evernote is to create a list of five to seven goals you’d like to accomplish in the near future. My advice is to create a notebook called !Goals, which will put the notebook near the top of your dashboard. Inside this notebook, create an individual ([1822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LKBEIXI&location=1822)) %% Color: yellow %% ^61947361

---

note filled with your goals for the next three months. (I prefer quarterly goals over yearly goals because they feel more immediate and important.)  Then open up this note on a daily basis and review each goal.

Idea #75: De-Clutter Your Life By now, you probably see how Evernote can help de-clutter your life. It does the following: • Organizes your digital life by creating central location for all your important paperwork, files and documents. • Replaces bulky filing cabinets. • Acts as a substitute for bulky items such as cookbooks and travel guides. • Eliminates the need to print out reference materials. • Creates a backup for all product warranties and documentation. • Creates checklist processes for regular cleaning activities.

While Evernote doesn’t magically clean your home for you, it can be used as a tool to better organize your home. You’ll find that once you’ve developed the habit of digitizing certain items, you’ll start to eliminate a lot of clutter you really don’t need. Picking YOUR Ideas These are just 75 ideas for getting started with Evernote. Should you try all of them at once? Definitely not. This app is like any other tool—the more it’s used, the more you’ll need it on a daily basis. Don’t worry if this previous list seems like a lot to do. My recommendation is to think of your biggest “problem” areas and use Evernote to solve them.  For instance, consider the challenges you face on a daily basis. Do you struggle to get things done? Are you buried under an avalanche of paperwork?  Do you often forget certain items at the grocery store?  Having trouble going from an idea to a completed project?  Evernote can help you fix all of these problems.
