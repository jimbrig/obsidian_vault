# Highlights 
With the aid of this example it is clearly seen that there is no such thing as an independently existing trajectory (lit. ‘path-curve’)6, but only a trajectory relative to a particular body of reference.  ^113029578

We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line goes through two points. We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals with things called ‘straight lines’, to each of which is ascribed the property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it.  ^113029579

I wished to show that space-time is not necessarily something to which one can ascribe a separate existence, independently of the actual objects of physical reality. Physical objects are not in space, but these objects are spatially extended. In this way the concept ‘empty space’ loses its meaning.  ^113029580

As is well known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of Galilei-Newton, which is known as the law of inertia, can be stated thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line.  ^113029581

---

A system of co-ordinates of which the state of motion is such that the law of inertia holds relative to it is called a ‘Galileian system of co-ordinates.’ The laws of the mechanics of Galilei-Newton can be regarded as valid only for a Galileian system of co-ordinates.  ^113029582

The law of the propagation of light in vacuo would then have to be replaced by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of relativity. The development of theoretical physics shows, however, that we cannot pursue this course.  ^113029583

---

However, the most careful observations have never revealed such anisotropic properties in terrestrial physical space, i.e. a physical non-equivalence of different directions. This is a very powerful argument in favour of the principle of relativity.  ^113029584

I stand at the window of a railway carriage which is travelling uniformly and drop a stone on the embankment, without throwing it. Then, disregarding the influence of the air resistance, I see the stone descend in a straight line. A pedestrian who observes the misdeed from the footpath notices that the stone falls to earth in a parabolic curve.  ^113029585

The resulting relationship takes for granted that the laws of Euclidean geometry hold for ‘distances’, the ‘distance’ being represented physically by means of the convention of two marks on a rigid body.  ^113029586

L. Boltzmann, according to whom matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler.  ^113029587
