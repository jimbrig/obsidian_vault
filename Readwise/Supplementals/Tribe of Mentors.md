# Highlights 
Real work and real satisfaction come from the opposite of what the web provides. They come from going deep into something—the book you’re writing, the album, the movie—and staying there for a long, long time.  ^75829962

---

Life punishes the vague wish and rewards the specific ask. After all, conscious thinking is largely asking and answering questions in your own head. If you want confusion and heartache, ask vague questions. If you want uncommon clarity and results, ask uncommonly clear questions.  ^75829963

---

“Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.”  ^75829964

---

Always take the time to acknowledge people—and not just when you know you have something to gain. If you show interest in them, they will be interested in you. People react to kindness with kindness, to respect with respect. Relationships—even brief ones—are doorways to opportunity.  ^75829965

---

What would this look like if it were easy? is such a lovely and deceptively leveraged question. It’s easy to convince yourself that things need to be hard, that if you’re not redlining, you’re not trying hard enough. This leads us to look for paths of most resistance, often creating unnecessary hardship in the process.  ^75829966

---

“Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage.”  ^75829967

---

Ego is about who’s right. Truth is about what’s right.  ^75829968

---

“Integrity is the only path where you will never get lost.”  ^75829969

---

“Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life.”  ^75829970

---

The Master Key System by Charles F. Haanel.  ^75829971

---

The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership by Jim Dethmer and Diana Chapman.  ^77311381

---

By focusing inward on yourself as a writer instead of outward on what you think readers will want to read, you’ll end up creating the best and most original work, and that one-in-a-thousand person who happens to love it will end up finding their way to you.  ^77311382

---

Happiness, or at least peace, is the sense that nothing is missing in this moment. No desires running amok. It’s okay to have a desire. But pick a big one and pick it carefully. Drop the small ones.  ^77311383

---

When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do? Memento mori—“remember that you have to die.” All of this will go to nothing. Remember before you were born? Just like that.  ^77311384

---

First, whenever possible, connect with others. Second, with enthusiasm, strive always to create fun and delight for others. And third, lean into each moment and encounter expecting magic—or miracles.  ^77311385

---

I’ve learned to envision the ideal end to any project before I begin it now—even the best gigs don’t last forever. Nor should they.  ^77311386

---

Everybody’s impatient at a macro, and just so patient at a micro, wasting your days worrying about years. I’m not worried about my years, because I’m squeezing the fuck out of my seconds, let alone my days. It’s going to work out.  ^77311387

---

The books Superforecasting (by Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner) and How to Measure Anything (by Douglas W. Hubbard) have some good advice on how to improve your ability to make accurate predictions. And Decisive (by Chip Heath and Dan Heath) explains four of the biggest judgment errors (like framing your decision too narrowly, or letting temporary emotions cloud your judgment) and gives tips for combating them.  ^77311388

---

“To laugh often and much, to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children . to leave the world a bit better . to know even one life has breathed easier because you lived.  ^77311389

---

I think humans can only feel real hatred of people they’re able to dehumanize in their heads. As soon as someone is exposed to reality and reminded of the full humanness of someone they hate, the hatred usually fades away and empathy pours in.  ^77311390

---

“People look for retreats for themselves, in the country, by the coast, or in the hills. There is nowhere that a person can find a more peaceful and trouble-free retreat than in his own mind. So constantly give yourself this retreat, and renew yourself.”  ^79186313

---

Happiness is a choice you make and a skill you develop.  ^79186314

---

The more you run from your fears, the bigger they get, but the more you go into them, the more they tend to vanish like a mirage.  ^79186315

---

Today when I speak with anyone about anything, I try to hold their perspective with a “light grip”: the knowledge that they, and I, have very incomplete maps of reality.  ^79186316

---

“It’s not how well you play the game, it’s deciding what game you want to play.”—Kwame Appiah.  ^79186317

---

“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done.  ^79186318

---

The player of the inner game comes to value the art of relaxed concentration above all other skills; he discovers the true basis for self-confidence; and he learns that the secret to winning any game lies in not trying too hard.  ^79186319

---

“Not Dead, Can’t Quit.”  ^79186320

---

The killer combination is high open-minded, high conscientious, low neurotic.  ^79186321

---

Simply put: You don’t find the time to do something; you make the time to do things.  ^79186322

---

Total Freedom by Jiddu Krishnamurti. A rationalist’s guide to the perils of the human mind. The “spiritual” book that I keep returning to.  ^80935642

---

Whenever I am trying to decide whether to accept an invitation, I just pretend it is going to happen tomorrow morning. It is easy to say yes to something happening six months from now, but it has to be super fantastic to get me to go tomorrow morning.  ^80935643

---

“Avoid compulsively making things worse.”  ^80935644

---

“Money in a business is like gas in your car. You need to pay attention so you don’t end up on the side of the road. But your trip is not a tour of gas stations.”  ^80935645

---

Map and Territory and How to Actually Change Your Mind by Eliezer Yudkowsky.  ^80935646

---

The older I get, the more time I spend—as a percentage of each day—on crafting better questions. In my experience, going from 1x to 10x, from 10x to 100x, and from 100x to (when Lady Luck really smiles) 1000x returns in various areas has been a product of better questions. John Dewey’s dictum that “a problem well put is half-solved” applies.  ^80935647

---

Happiness is about understanding that the gift of life should be honored every day by offering your gifts to the world.  ^80935648

---

Don’t let someone knock you off course before you reach your destination. Trust the work. Always trust the work.  ^80935649

---

Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Say you’re running and you think, “Man, this hurts, I can’t take it anymore.” The “hurt” part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself.  ^80935650

---

It helped me realize that the secret to change and growth is not willpower, but positive community.  ^80935651

---

Good questions in the wrong order get bad responses. Conversely, you can punch well above your weight class by thinking about sequencing, as most people don’t.  ^84201230

---

“The difference between winning and losing is most often not quitting.”  ^84201232

---

What’s helped with saying no to others is asking myself first if I’m saying yes out of guilt or fear. If so, then it’s a polite no.  ^84201233

---

“You can be a juicy ripe peach and there’ll still be someone who doesn’t like peaches.”  ^84201234

---

Based on everything I’ve seen, a simple recipe can work: focus on what’s in front of you, design great days to create a great life, and try not to make the same mistake twice.  ^84201235

---

You are the author of your own life, and it’s never too late to replace the stories you tell yourself and the world. It’s never too late to begin a new chapter, add a surprise twist, or change genres entirely.  ^84201236

---

Excellence is the next five minutes, improvement is the next five minutes, happiness is the next five minutes.  ^84201237

---

“What makes a river so restful to people is that it doesn’t have any doubt—it is sure to get where it is going, and it doesn’t want to go anywhere else.”—Hal Boyle.  ^84201238

---

“Look for a partner you’ll try to impress daily, and one who will try to impress you.” Over the last couple decades, I’ve noticed that the best, most enduring partnerships in business (and in life) are among people who are constantly growing together. If the person you choose to depend on is constantly striving to learn and improve, you too will push yourself to new levels of achievement, and neither of you will feel like you have settled for someone you eventually outgrow.  ^84201240

---

“What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”  ^84201241

---

Note that criticism is not failure. If you’re not being criticized, you’re probably not doing anything exceptional.  ^86733242

---

Ignore any advice that tells you you are going to miss something. Every mistake I have ever made in business, marriage, and personal conduct was because I thought if I didn’t do or get this now, it was never going to happen.  ^86733243

---

We discourage failure and by doing so we subtly discourage success.  ^86733244

---

Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why, by Laurence Gonzales.  ^86733245

---

I don’t think failure is sometimes part of the process—it always is. When you feel you can’t go on, know that you’re just getting started.  ^86733246

---

Greatness is not a final destination, but a series of small acts done daily in order to constantly rejuvenate and refresh our skills in a daily effort to become a better version of ourselves.  ^86733247

---

Ernest Hemingway on Writing: The most potent little book of wisdom on the creative process that I have run into.  ^86733248

---

Earplugs for sleeping. I’ve tried them all. Hearos Xtreme Protection NRR 33 work best and are the most comfortable. If you really want to go to extremes to also control light, Lonfrote Deep Molded Sleep Mask is the best for airplanes or anywhere else.  ^86733249

---

SleepPhones. It’s a headband that goes over your eyes and ears and that has inside two ultraflat earphones so you can listen to books as you fall asleep.  ^86733250

---

The best advice I have seen comes from people who don’t try to tell me the answer . instead they give me a new approach to thinking about the question so that I can solve it better on my own.  ^86733251

---

“Things are never as good or as bad as they seem.”  ^96010810

---

Life will present you with unexpected opportunities, and you won’t always know in advance which are the important moments. Above all, it’s the quality of your relationships that will determine the quality of your life. Invest in your connections, even those that seem inconsequential.  ^96010811

---

Mother Dirt: It cured my acne and skin problems permanently. It’s a $49 spray with oxidizing bacteria that you use in place of soap, and it restores your skin to its natural balance. If I could buy this for every teenager in America, I would.  ^96010812

---

“Don’t let the weight of fear weigh down the joy of curiosity.” Fear is really false evidence appearing real.  ^96010813

---

“You are 99 years old, you are on your deathbed, and you have a chance to come back to right now: what would you do?”  ^96010814

---

One of my favorite quotes is by Ralph Waldo Emerson: “To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children . to leave the world a bit better . to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived; this is to have succeeded.”  ^96010815

---

Thinking of what makes me happy doesn’t give me the same clarity as thinking about what gives me bliss.  ^96010816

---

Persistence matters more than talent. The student with straight As is irrelevant if the student sitting next to him with Bs has more passion.  ^96010817

---

This purchase is not less than $100, but at $159, it is too close to pass up: the HeartMath Inner Balance biofeedback monitor. It detects your heart’s minutest rhythms and sends a graph to your smartphone, facilitating HRV training.  ^96010818

---

You don’t “succeed” because you have no weaknesses; you succeed because you find your unique strengths and focus on developing habits around them.  ^96010819
