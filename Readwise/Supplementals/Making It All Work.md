# Highlights 
Loss of control and perspective is the natural price you will pay for being creative and productive. The trick is not how to prevent this happening, but how to shorten the time you stay in an unsettled state.  ^61948002

---

In brief, you just need to decide whether something is actionable or not, and then determine the outcomes and actions required for those things you’ve committed to move on; for those that don’t have an action tied to them, decide what’s trash, what’s to be reviewed later, and what’s to be classified as reference.  ^61948003

---

In order to relieve the pressure of broken self-agreements, you must know that: • You have captured, clarified, and organized your commitments, at all horizons, and • You will consciously engage with them as often as you need to.  ^61948004

---

The definition of work I will use in this book is quite universal: anything you want to get done that’s not done yet.  ^61948005

---

“Finish your thinking” simply means to decide what the next physical thing to do is to move them forward from where they are. This is a prime example of not putting the appropriate attention on what has your attention. You need to think about your stuff more than you think, but not as much as you’re afraid you might.  ^61948006

---

Half of the secret to achieving clarity in any situation is asking, “What are we trying to do here?” The other half, and at least as critical, is, “What’s the next action?”  ^61948007

---

The art of mastering work flow, by collecting, processing, organizing, reviewing, and doing, provides the component of control. The Natural Planning Model and the Horizons of Focus both supply perspective.  ^61948008

---

If you don’t pay attention to what has your attention, it will take more of your attention than it deserves.  ^61948009

---

Being organized simply means that where things are suits what they mean to you.  ^61948010

---

Control without perspective is micromanagement, and perspective without control is crazy-making.  ^61948011

---

In the simplest terms, there are only two things you or your team or company needs to do to achieve positive and productive engagement with the commitments you face and to achieve all of the desired results above: get organized and get focused.  ^158350085

---

You can’t really manage time; time just is. What you can manage is yourself— your focus and your actions.  ^158350086

---

It’s a great idea, when starting meetings that are held regularly, whether in a department or a family, to have everyone contribute what primarily has their attention at the moment.  ^158350087

---

The fundamental engagement question is, “What’s the next action?” The answer creates the bridge from the invisible to the visible, from idea into reality, and (if you’re not allergic to the term) from the spiritual to the physical.  ^158350089

---

I define “projects” very broadly as outcomes that can be finished within a year that involve more than one action.  ^158350090

---

The future is not some place we are going, but one we are creating. The paths are not to be found, but made. And the activity of making them changes both the maker and their destination.  ^158350091

---

There are five stages to achieving control and six Horizons of Focus that lead to the gaining of perspective.  ^158350092

---

Winning at the game of work and the business of life is not maintaining everything in perfect order but rather having sufficient familiarity with the use of the road map of the horizontal and vertical aspects of experience to be able to quickly gain coherence and reorient yourself for the next round when you’re faced with disruption.  ^158350094

---

The key distinction to be made about anything that has potential meaning, system-wise, in your world is to determine whether it falls under the heading of outcomes, actions, things incubating, support material, reference, or trash.  ^158350096

---

In truth the concept of needing to “get organized” should be re-conceived to “get control,” for which getting organized is only a part of the solution—and not the first one, at that. Likewise, “set priorities” needs to be amplified to “clarify our objectives at the appropriate horizon,” which will entail much more thought than simply formulating a strategic plan.  ^158350098

---

Reviewing your system serves two distinct but equally critical purposes: (a) to update its contents and (b) to provide trusted perspective.  ^179464477

---

You never know how much of your attention is being held captive by a physical space until you do a thorough job of purging it and notice how different you then feel.  ^179464478

---

The best criteria to determine whether or not you’ve actually thought something through sufficiently to act upon it is how clearly you can answer these three questions: • What has to happen first? • What does doing look like?  ^179464479

---

One easy way to identify your own relevant categories at the Areas of Focus level for yourself is to examine your projects and your actions and ask yourself, “Why am I doing that? What area of interest or responsibility does it reflect?”  ^179464480

---

The world can only be grasped by action, not by contemplation. The hand is more important than the eye . The hand is the cutting edge of the mind.  ^179464481

---

Just as the tumultuous chaos of a thunderstorm brings a nurturing rain that allows life to flourish, so too in human affairs times of advancement are preceded by times of disorder. Success comes to those who can weather the storm.  ^179464482

---

The biggest culprits that elude objective capture at this level are the subjects that you consider “problems,” which you have yet to recognize as projects.  ^179464483

---

For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.  ^179464484

---

People experience great relief, individually and in a group context, in simply knowing that all the puzzle pieces are on the table.  ^179464485

---

The reason for the “within a year” parameter is that any commitment you have that can be completed in that time period—even very big ones—should probably be reviewed at least once a week.  ^179464486
