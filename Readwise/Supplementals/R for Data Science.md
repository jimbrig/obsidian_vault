# Highlights 
Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.  ^64986859

Advanced R by Hadley Wickham. This dives into the details of R the programming language. This is a great place to start if you have existing programming experience. It’s also a great next step once you’ve internalized the ideas in these chapters. You can read it online at http://adv-r.had.co.nz.  ^64986860

There are many functions for creating new variables that you can use with mutate(). The key property is that the function must be vectorized: it must take a vector of values as input, and return a vector with the same number of values as output.  ^64986861

If you need to add more text, there are two other useful labels that you can use in ggplot2 2.2.0 and above (which should be available by the time you’re reading this book): subtitle adds additional detail in a smaller font beneath the title.  ^64986862

RStudio tip: a useful keyboard shortcut is Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-P. This resends the previously sent chunk from the editor to the console. This is very convenient when you’re (e.g.) exploring the value of n in the preceding example. You send the whole block once with Cmd/Ctrl-Enter, then you modify the value of n and press Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-P to resend the complete block.  ^64986863

If variation describes the behavior within a variable, covariation describes the behavior between variables. Covariation is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way. The best way to spot covariation is to visualize the relationship between two or more variables. How you do that should again depend on the type of variables involved.  ^64986864

Lists are a step up in complexity from atomic vectors, because lists can contain other lists. This makes them suitable for representing hierarchical or tree-like structures.  ^64986865

What happened to the SUVs? ggplot2 will only use six shapes at a time. By default, additional groups will go unplotted when you use this aesthetic.  ^64986866

The goal of a model is not to uncover truth, but to discover a simple approximation that is still useful.  ^64986867

There is no rule about which questions you should ask to guide your research. However, two types of questions will always be useful for making discoveries within your data.  ^64986868
