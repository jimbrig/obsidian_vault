# Highlights 
With all its imperfections, modern science is a technique that is sufficiently well tuned to nature so that it works—it is a practice that allows us to learn reliable things about the world. In this sense, it is a technique that was waiting for people to discover it.  ^113158605

So this book is not solely about how we came to learn various things about the world. That is naturally a concern of any history of science. My focus in this book is a little different—it is how we came to learn how to learn about the world.  ^113158606

I don’t mean to say that Aristotle’s philosophy was seen by his followers and successors as an alternative to science. There was no conception in the ancient or medieval world of science as something distinct from philosophy. Thinking about the natural world was philosophy.  ^113158607

A few years after the publication of De Revolutionibus, Luther’s colleague Philipp Melanchthon (1497–1560) joined the attack on Copernicus, now citing Ecclesiastes 1:5—“The Sun also rises, and the Sun goes down, and hastens to his place where he rose.”  ^113158608

Hipparchus, generally regarded as the greatest astronomical observer of the ancient world.12 Hipparchus made astronomical observations in Alexandria from 161 BC to 146 BC, and then continued until 127 BC, perhaps on the island of Rhodes.  ^113158609

There is an important feature of modern science that is almost completely missing in all the thinkers I have mentioned, from Thales to Plato: none of them attempted to verify or even (aside perhaps from Zeno) seriously to justify their speculations. In reading their writings, one continually wants to ask, “How do you know?”  ^113158610

---

Today we look beyond the chemical elements to the elementary particles of which atoms are composed, but one way or another we continue the search, begun at Miletus, for the fundamental constituents of nature.  ^113158611

---

Aristotle was a realist in a common modern sense: for him, though categories were deeply interesting, it was individual things, like individual pine trees, that were real, not Plato’s forms.  ^113158612

---

One of Aristotle’s classifications was pervasive in his work, and became an obstacle for the future of science.  ^113158613

The experiments described in Two New Sciences made a historic break with the past. Instead of limiting himself to the study of free fall, which Aristotle had regarded as natural motion, Galileo turned to artificial motions, of balls constrained to roll down an inclined plane or projectiles thrown forward. In this sense, Galileo’s inclined plane is a distant ancestor of today’s particle accelerators, with which we artificially create particles found nowhere in nature.  ^113158614
