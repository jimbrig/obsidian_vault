# Highlights 
At his friends’ urging, Lincoln in March 1832 announced himself a candidate for the state legislature. The move was another demonstration of the young man’s supreme self-confidence, his belief that he was at least the equal, if not the superior, of any man he ever met.  ^113029558

The details were irrelevant. What mattered was that Lincoln proved that he had immense strength and courage, and that was enough to win the admiration of the Clary’s Grove gang. Thereafter they became Lincoln’s most loyal and enthusiastic admirers.  ^113029559

“He must understand every thing—even to the smallest thing—minutely and exactly,” she remembered; “he would then repeat it over to himself again and again—some times in one form and then in an other and when it was fixed in his mind to suit him he ... never lost that fact or his understanding of it.”  ^113029560

Like other gifted young men, he wondered how he could be the offspring of his ordinary and limited parents.  ^113029561

Lincoln seems to have had the unusual notion that a public servant’s first duty is to help people, rather than to follow bureaucratic regulations. If residents did not pick up their mail at the post office in Samuel Hill’s store, he would often put the letters in his hat and deliver them in person, sometimes walking several miles to do so.  ^113029562

The real excitement at the convention, however, was over Lincoln’s speech. “Ichabod [Codding] raved, and Lovejoy swelled,” the Register reported, and all pronounced it “a glorious abolition speech, worthy of Ichabod himself,... [which] ought to be reiterated all over the country.” Although disappointed that Lincoln failed to attend, the Republicans, without asking his consent, named him to their state central committee.  ^113029563

Confronted with the problem, “he looked first at one and then the other, and declared there was some mistake.” Assured that there was no error, the President, as Welles remembered, “took upon himself the whole blame, said it was carelessness, heedlessness on his part” and that “he ought to have been more careful and attentive.” He directed that the Powhatan be restored to Fox’s expedition.  ^113029564

Running a household required money, and Lincoln set about earning it with greater energy than he had ever before demonstrated. A few years later, in notes he prepared for a lecture on the legal profession, he began, “The leading rule for the lawyer, as for the man, of every calling, is diligence.” He was speaking from experience. He worked incessantly, handling virtually every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer.  ^113029565

There’s a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will.  ^113029566

Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809.  ^113029567
