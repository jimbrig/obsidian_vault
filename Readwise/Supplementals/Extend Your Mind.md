# Highlights 
Instead of seeing the final product (the deliverable we sell to the client) as the only repository of value, we package up all the intermediate steps — the research, notes, brainstorms, examples, outlines, prototypes, drafts, and even crazy ideas we choose not to pursue — as reusable components for later consumption.  ^113029618

Since we don’t have enough time in one stretch to get into flow, we spend most of our day in struggle. We feel as if we’re interrupted from the current interruption by yet another interruption. This is how you can work hard all day, yet walk away with the distinct impression you didn’t get anything done.  ^113029619

---

Organizing your work in intermediate packets has an extraordinary effect: you become interruption-proof. Because you rarely even try to load the entire project into your mind at once, there isn’t much to lose if someone taps you on the shoulder.  ^113029620

The inventory of knowledge work is ideas. What you are selling, as a “worker of knowledge,” are the ideas you’ve “processed” through the focused application of your attention.  ^113029621

---

If ideas are the inventory of knowledge work, then reducing our batch sizes requires changing not how we manage tasks and projects, but how we manage the information content of those projects.  ^113029622

---

We learn faster when we pay attention and see the world for what it truly is, not for what it should have been.  ^113029623

---

The rewards of education are too far off and abstract to appeal to our lizard brains — we need a reward now to stay engaged, in the form of amusement, surprise, drama, or laughter.  ^113029624

---

Psychological Capital: one’s positive appraisal of circumstances and probability for success based on motivated effort and perseverance.  ^113029625

---

This requires a set of skills never before associated with formal teaching: authentic personal sharing, irreverence and wit, surprising and delighting, and most of all, a continuous effort at what I call Whystorming.  ^113029626

Charging premium prices is so effective because it solves many problems at once: instantly filters out those for whom spending that much is out of the question; unmistakably signals the quality and personal attention being offered; frames it as an investment and level-upper; and of course, allows you to actually spend the time it takes to deliver on these expectations.  ^113029627
