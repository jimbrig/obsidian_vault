# Highlights 
When everything feels urgent and important, everything seems equal. We become active and busy, but this doesn’t actually move us any closer to success. Activity is often unrelated to productivity, and busyness rarely takes care of business.  ^61947962

---

Passion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it. That time spent eventually translates to skill, and when skill improves, results improve. Better results generally lead to more enjoyment, and more passion and more time is invested. It can be a virtuous cycle all the way to extraordinary results.  ^61947963

---

It’s not that we have too little time to do all the things we need to do, it’s that we feel the need to do too many things in the time we have.  ^61947964

---

Success is actually a short race—a sprint fueled by discipline just long enough for habit to kick in and take over.  ^61947965

---

Where I’d had huge success, I had narrowed my concentration to one thing, and where my success varied, my focus had too.  ^61947966

---

Instead of a to-do list, you need a success list—a list that is purposefully created around extraordinary results.  ^61947967

---

The key is over time. Success is built sequentially. It’s one thing at a time.  ^61947968

---

The path of mastering something is the combination of not only doing the best you can do at it, but also doing it the best it can be done.  ^61947969

---

You need to be doing fewer things for more effect instead of doing more things with side effects.  ^61947970

---

The trick to success is to choose the right habit and bring just enough discipline to establish it.  ^61947971

---

The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret to getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting on the first one.  ^104464582

---

Block an hour each week to review your annual and monthly goals.  ^104464583

---

The research and experience of others is the best place to start when looking for your answer.  ^104464584

---

THE HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE PERSON’S DAILY ENERGY PLAN Meditate and pray for spiritual energy. Eat right, exercise, and sleep sufficiently for physical energy. Hug, kiss, and laugh with loved ones for emotional energy. Set goals, plan, and calendar for mental energy. Time block your ONE Thing for business energy.  ^104464585

---

Anyone who dreams of an uncommon life eventually discovers there is no choice but to seek an uncommon approach to living it.  ^104464586

---

A life worth living might be measured in many ways, but the one way that stands above all others is living a life of no regrets.  ^104464587

---

To achieve extraordinary results and experience greatness, time block these three things in the following order: Time block your time off. Time block your ONE Thing. Time block your planning time.  ^104464588

---

The reason we shouldn’t pursue balance is that the magic never happens in the middle; magic happens at the extremes.  ^104464589

---

If disproportionate results come from one activity, then you must give that one activity disproportionate time.  ^104464590

---

How we phrase the questions we ask ourselves determines the answers that eventually become our life.  ^104464591

---

Who we are and where we want to go determine what we do and what we accomplish.  ^169753596

---

When you do the right thing, it can liberate you from having to monitor everything.  ^169753597

---

Happiness happens on the way to fulfillment.  ^169753598

---

So how do you put your willpower to work? You think about it. Pay attention to it. Respect it. You make doing what matters most a priority when your willpower is its highest. In other words, you give it the time of day it deserves.  ^169753599

---

One of our biggest challenges is making sure our life’s purpose doesn’t become a beggar’s bowl, a bottomless pit of desire continually searching for the next thing that will make us happy. That’s a losing proposition.  ^169753600

---

Taking complete ownership of your outcomes by holding no one but yourself responsible for them is the most powerful thing you can do to drive your success.  ^169753601

---

To experience extraordinary results, be a maker in the morning and a manager in the afternoon.  ^169753602

---

To achieve an extraordinary result you must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands.  ^169753603

---

Achievers operate differently. They have an eye for the essential. They pause just long enough to decide what matters and then allow what matters to drive their day. Achievers do sooner what others plan to do later and defer, perhaps indefinitely, what others do sooner. The difference isn’t in intent, but in right of way. Achievers always work from a clear sense of priority.  ^169753604

---

No one knows their ultimate ceiling for achievement, so worrying about it is a waste of time.  ^169753605
