# Highlights 
We (1) capture what has our attention; (2) clarify what each item means and what to do about it; (3) organize the results, which presents the options we (4) reflect on, which we then choose to (5) engage with.  ^61947972

---

As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.  ^61947973

---

Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an “open loop,” which will be pulling on your attention if it’s not appropriately managed.  ^61947974

---

Getting things done requires two basic components: defining (1) what “done” means (outcome) and (2) what “doing” looks like (action).  ^61947975

---

I define a project as any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step.  ^61947976

---

There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.  ^61947977

---

Things rarely get stuck because of lack of time. They get stuck because what “doing” would look like, and where it happens, hasn’t been decided.  ^61947978

---

Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax.  ^61947979

---

Vertical control, in contrast, manages thinking, development, and coordination of individual topics and projects.  ^61947980

---

Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action.  ^61947981

---

The Weekly Review is the time to: Gather and process all your stuff. Review your system. Update your lists. Get clean, clear, current, and complete.  ^68188570

---

There is always more to do than you can do, and you can do only one thing at a time. The key is to feel as good about what you’re not doing as about what you are doing at that moment.  ^68188571

---

There is usually an inverse relationship between how much something is on your mind and how much it’s getting done.  ^68188572

---

A task left undone remains undone in two places—at the actual location of the task, and inside your head. Incomplete tasks in your head consume the energy of your attention as they gnaw at your conscience.  ^68188573

---

Thought is useful when it motivates action and a hindrance when it substitutes for action.  ^68188574

---

We need to transform all the “stuff” we’ve attracted and accumulated into a clear inventory of meaningful actions, projects, and usable information.  ^68188575

---

To manage actionable things, you will need a list of projects, storage or files for project plans and materials, a calendar, a list of reminders of next actions, and a list of reminders of things you’re waiting for.  ^68188576

---

Anything that causes you to overreact or underreact can control you, and often does. Responding inappropriately to your e-mail, your thoughts about what you need to do, your children, or your boss will lead to less effective results than you’d like. Most people give either more or less attention to things than they deserve, simply because they don’t operate with a mind like water.  ^68188577

---

There is one thing we can do, and the happiest people are those who can do it to the limit of their ability. We can be completely present. We can be all here. We can give . our attention to the opportunity before us.  ^68188578

---

Ask yourself, “When do I need to see what, in what form, to get it off my mind?” You build a system for function, not just to have a system.  ^68188579

---

One of the most powerful life skills, and one of the most important to hone and develop for both professional and personal success, is creating clear outcomes.  ^96010710

---

Healthy skepticism is often the best way to glean the value of what’s being presented—challenge it; prove it wrong, if you can. That creates engagement, which is the key to understanding.  ^96010711

---

Now, describe, in a single written sentence, your intended successful outcome for this problem or situation.  ^96010712

---

Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior.  ^96010713

---

An ambient angst pervades our society—there’s a sense that somehow there’s probably something we should be doing that we’re not, which creates a tension for which there is no resolution and from which there is no rest.  ^96010714

---

You don’t actually do a project; you can only do action steps related to it.  ^96010715

---

Here’s how I define “stuff”: anything you have allowed into your psychological or physical world that doesn’t belong where it is, but for which you haven’t yet determined what, exactly, it means to you, with the desired outcome and the next action step.  ^96010716

---

All of your Projects, active project plans, and Next Actions, Agendas, Waiting For, and even Someday/Maybe lists should be reviewed once a week.  ^96010717

---

Think like a man of action, act like a man of thought.  ^96010718

---

In order to eliminate “holes in your bucket,” you need to collect and gather placeholders for, or representations of, all the things you consider incomplete in your world—that is, anything personal or professional, big or little, of urgent or minor importance, that you think ought to be different than it currently is and that you have any level of internal commitment to changing.  ^96010719

---

The big secret to efficient creative and productive thinking and action is to put the right things in your focus at the right time.  ^160366411

---

Thinking in a concentrated manner to define desired outcomes and requisite next actions is something few people feel they have to do (until they have to). But in truth, it is the most effective means available for making wishes a reality.  ^160366412

---

The way I look at it, the calendar should be sacred territory. If you write something there, it must get done that day or not at all. The only rewriting should be for changed appointments.  ^160366413

---

The best practice is to keep your digital reference world as simple as possible, and consistently reviewed and purged.  ^160366414

---

Often the only way to make a hard decision is to come back to the purpose of what you’re doing.  ^160366415

---

Any “would, could, or should” commitment held only in the psyche creates irrational and unresolvable pressure, 24-7.  ^160366416

---

What does need to be tracked is every action that has to happen at a specific time or on a specific day (enter those on your calendar); those that need to be done as soon as they can (add these to your Next Actions lists); and all those that you are waiting for others to do (put these on a Waiting For list).  ^160366417

---

As soon as you attach a “should,” “need to,” or “ought to” to an item, it becomes an incomplete.  ^160366418

---

The Value of Thinking About Why Here are just some of the benefits of asking why: It defines success. It creates decision-making criteria. It aligns resources. It motivates. It clarifies focus. It expands options.  ^160366419

---

Minute-to-minute and day-to-day you don’t have time to think. You need to have already thought.  ^160366420

---

We can never really be prepared for that which is wholly new. We have to adjust ourselves, and every radical adjustment is a crisis in self-esteem; we undergo a test, we have to prove ourselves. It needs subordinate self-confidence to face drastic change without inner trembling.  ^175313368

---

Complete the projects you begin, fulfill the commitments you have made, live up to your promises—then both your subconscious and conscious selves can have success, which leads to a feeling of fulfillment, worthiness and oneness.  ^175313369

---

The art of resting the mind and the power of dismissing from it all care and worry is probably one of the secrets of our great men.  ^175313370

---

It is easier to act yourself into a better way of feeling than to feel yourself into a better way of action.  ^175313371

---

The sense of anxiety and guilt doesn’t come from having too much to do; it’s the automatic result of breaking agreements with yourself.  ^175313372

---

THE KEY INGREDIENTS of relaxed control are (1) clearly defined outcomes (projects) and the next actions required to move them toward closure, and (2) reminders placed in a trusted system that is reviewed regularly. This is what I call horizontal focus.  ^175313373

---

Every now and then go away and have a little relaxation. To remain constantly at work will diminish your judgment. Go some distance away, because work will be in perspective and a lack of harmony is more readily seen.  ^175313374

---

You must use your mind to get things off your mind.  ^175313375

---

Every decision to act is an intuitive one. The challenge is to migrate from hoping it’s the right choice to trusting it’s the right choice.  ^175313376

---

Vision is not enough; it must be combined with venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps; we must step up the stairs.  ^175313377
