# Highlights 
Because in each case the future behavior is completely determined by the initial state, such laws are deterministic. All the basic laws of classical mechanics are deterministic.  ^113157769

---

Whenever a dynamical law divides the state-space into such separate cycles, there is a memory of which cycle they started in. Such a memory is called a conservation law; it tells us that something is kept intact for all time.  ^113157770

---

According to the rules of classical physics, not all laws are legal. It’s not enough for a dynamical law to be deterministic; it must also be reversible.  ^113157771

---

Figuring out the best way to explain something is almost always the best way to understand it yourself.  ^113157772

---

In classical physics, if you know everything about a system at some instant of time, and you also know the equations that govern how the system changes, then you can predict the future. That’s what we mean when we say that the classical laws of physics are deterministic. If we can say the same thing, but with the past and future reversed, then the same equations tell you everything about the past. Such a system is called reversible.  ^113157773

---

The ability to distinguish the neighboring values of these numbers is the “resolving power” of any experiment, and for any real observer it is limited.  ^113157774

---

A world whose evolution is discrete could be called stroboscopic.  ^113157775

---

The job of classical mechanics is to predict the future.  ^113157776

---

In physics jargon, the collection of all states occupied by a system is its space of states, or, more simply, its state-space.  ^113157777

---

There must be one arrow to tell you where you’re going and one to tell you where you came from.  ^113157778
