By reimagining an uncomfortable internal trigger, we can disarm it. •    Step 1. Look for the emotion preceding distraction. •    Step 2. Write down the internal trigger. •    Step 3. Explore the negative sensation with curiosity instead of contempt. •    Step 4. Be extra cautious during liminal moments.  ^113029597
