# Highlights 
As the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines, rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest, so have the living waters left their living drift on our mountain summits, in a line gently rising from the Arctic lowlands to a great altitude under the equator.  ^113029530

Although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists until recently entertained, and which I formerly entertained—namely, that each species has been independently created—is erroneous.  ^113029531

---

Who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare? Yet these relations are of the highest importance, for they determine the present welfare and, as I believe, the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world.  ^113029532

Hence if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any peculiarity, he will almost certainly modify unintentionally other parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of correlation.  ^113029533

Though later-evolving groups are more highly organized, he rightly argued that we should not expect all groups and types of organisms to evolve in the direction of higher organization. Thus single-celled forms, through the very fact of their small size and rapid reproduction, fill a certain natural niche more successfully than larger multicellular creatures can do.  ^113029534

---

Embryological resemblances of all kinds can be accounted for, as we shall hereafter see, by the progenitors of our existing species having varied after early youth, and having transmitted their newly acquired characters to their offspring, at a corresponding age. The embryo is thus left almost unaffected, and serves as a record of the past condition of the species.  ^113029535

---

Thus he deduced that natural selection must inevitably bring about the “improvement” of organisms, improvement which, as he characteristically added, was always in relation to the conditions of life.  ^113029536

---

As two men have sometimes independently hit on the same invention, so in the several foregoing cases it appears that natural selection, working for the good of each being, and taking advantage of all favourable variations, has produced similar organs, as far as function is concerned, in distinct organic beings, which owe none of their structure in common to inheritance from a common progenitor.  ^113029537

---

In some cases, however, the extermination of whole groups, as of ammonites, towards the close of the secondary period, has been wonderfully sudden.  ^113029538

Furthermore, I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the most important, but not the exclusive, means of modification.  ^113029539
