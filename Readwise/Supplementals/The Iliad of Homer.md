# Highlights 
At the same time, the rewards of their fighting, whether cattle, weapons, or women, are visible marks of the honor they hold in the community, and a means of maintaining status among fellow warriors. For this reason, the quarrel between Achilleus and Agamemnon is deadly serious.  ^113029661

For Hektor the huge will not sooner be stayed from his fighting until there stirs by the ships the swift-footed son of Peleus 475  on that day when they shall fight by the sterns of the beached ships in the narrow place of necessity over fallen Patroklos.  ^113029662

Straightway he sent down the most lordly of birds, an eagle, with a fawn, the young of the running deer, caught in his talons, who cast down the fawn beside Zeus’ splendid altar 250  where the Achaians wrought their devotions to Zeus of the Voices.  ^113029663

Troy, it appears, was a vassal state. Hittite official documents mention Taruwisa and Wilusa, which closely match the Greek words used, apparently as synonyms, for the besieged city in the Iliad: Troiê and (w) Ilios (traces of an original initial “w” sound can be detected in the Iliad’s verses).  ^113029664

First of all, it is important to realize that the Iliad is an Iron Age poem about an event supposed to have taken place in the Bronze Age.  ^113029665

---

But Achilleus weeping went and sat in sorrow apart from his companions 350  beside the beach of the gray sea looking out on the infinite water.  ^113029666

---

Life is a struggle each person will ultimately always lose; the question is how one acts with that knowledge.  ^113029667

---

The Iliad is about heroes as humans, and what constitutes humanity. Its enduring value lies in the poem’s recognition that even the worst enemies are deeply, fundamentally the same—desirous of glory and immortality, while subject to pain and death. Its power—like that of so much Greek literature—comes from the realistic depiction of mortals as they gradually learn that they can never be gods. In this existential recognition, it transcends the anxieties of tribe or state.  ^113029668

---

Here, another aspect of the Iliad vision becomes crucial: the importance of companionship.  ^113029669

What makes the epic monumental is a further basic principle of retardation.  ^113029670
