# Highlights 
It was Lincoln's habit to let his generals do their work in their own ways, only insisting that they should accomplish visible and tangible results.  ^113029752

---

The campaign had been one of unusual excitement and it was followed by that apathy which is the common sequel to all excessive activity.  ^113029753

---

In the fifteen slave states he received no electoral vote. In ten states not one person had voted for him.  ^113029754

---

He once said he thought the Lord particularly loved plain people, for he had made so many of them.  ^113029755

---

"Lincoln is one of those peculiar men who perform with admirable skill whatever they undertake."  ^113029756

---

Lincoln's characterization is apt: "Judge Douglas is playing cuttlefish--a small species of fish that has no mode of defending himself when pursued except by throwing out a black fluid which makes the water so dark the enemy cannot see it, and thus it escapes."  ^113029757

---

Lincoln himself felt the stirring impulse. It is not uncommon for the call of duty, or opportunity, to come once in a lifetime to the heart of a man with over-mastering power, so that his purposes and powers are roused to an unwonted and transforming degree of activity.  ^113029758

---

He who would control others must first control himself. It is hard to imagine a more severe test than this imposed on Lincoln during this period of waiting. He made his preparations in silence, and not an injudicious word escaped him.  ^113029759

---

They may say they do, but there are some things which neither man nor woman ever tells. In the heart of love there is a Holy of Holies into which the most intimate friend is not allowed to look.  ^113029760

---

The present writer never saw Lincoln's face but twice, once in life and once in death. Both times it seemed to him, and as he remembers it after the lapse of more than a third of a century, it still seems to him, the saddest face his eyes have ever looked upon.  ^113029761
