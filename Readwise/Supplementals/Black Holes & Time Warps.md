# Highlights 
The only important thing is that events in spacetime are analogous to points in space, and there is an absolute interval between any two events in spacetime completely analogous to the straight-line distance between any two points on a flat sheet of paper.  ^113157803

Under most circumstances (for example, throughout the solar system), the pressure of matter is tiny compared to its mass density times the speed of light squared, and therefore the pressure is an unimportant contributor to spacetime curvature; the spacetime warpage is due almost solely to mass.  ^113157804

Once in the form of iron, the matter can release no more nuclear energy by any means whatsoever. The nuclear force holds neutrons and protons together more tightly when they form iron nuclei than when they form any other kind of atomic nucleus.  ^113157805

As we shall see in the coming pages, gravity is produced by a curvature (a warpage) of spacetime’s absolute, four-dimensional fabric, and black holes, wormholes, gravitational waves, and singularities are all constructed wholly and solely from that fabric; that is, each of them is a specific type of spacetime warpage.  ^113157806

My time differs from yours if I move relative to you, and my space differs from yours. My time is a mixture of your time and your space; my space is a mixture of your space and your time.  ^113157807

Within days after formulating his equivalence principle, Einstein used it to make an amazing prediction, called gravitational time dilation: If one is at rest relative to a gravitating body, then the nearer one is to the body, the more slowly one’s time must flow. For example, in a room on Earth, time must flow more slowly near the floor than near the ceiling.  ^113157808

Einstein’s law of spacetime warpage, the Einstein field equation, states that “mass and pressure warp spacetime.”  ^113157809

As you fall toward Earth, tidal gravitational forces stretch you from head to foot and squeeze you from the sides. As seen from Earth (Figure 2.3a), the gravitational pull is slightly different on various parts of your body. Because your feet are closer to the Earth than your head, gravity pulls more strongly on them than on your head, so it stretches you from foot to head. And because gravity pulls always toward the Earth’s center, a direction that is slightly leftward on your right side and slightly rightward on your left side, the pull is slightly leftward on your right and slightly rightward on your left; that is, it squeezes your sides inward.  ^113157810

How truly nonsingular the Schwarzschild singularity (critical circumference) is did not become fully clear until David Finkelstein discovered his new reference frame and used it to show that the Schwarzschild singularity is nothing but a location into which things can fall but out of which nothing can come—and a location, therefore, into which we on the outside can never see. An imploding star continues to exist after it sinks through the Schwarzschild singularity, Finkelstein’s reference frame showed, just as the Sun continues to exist after it sinks below the horizon on Earth. But just as we, sitting on Earth, cannot see the Sun beyond our horizon, so observers far from an imploding star cannot see the star after it implodes through the Schwarzschild singularity. This analogy motivated Wolfgang Rindler, a physicist at Cornell University in the 1950s, to give the Schwarzschild singularity (critical circumference) a new name, a name that has since stuck: He called it the horizon.  ^113157811
