# Highlights 
Storyboarding is perhaps the single most important thing you can do up front to ensure the communication you craft is on point. The storyboard establishes a structure for your communication. It is a visual outline of the content you plan to create.  ^113029769

Slopegraphs can be useful when you have two time periods or points of comparison and want to quickly show relative increases and decreases or differences across various categories between the two data points.  ^113029770

---

Exploratory analysis is what you do to understand the data and figure out what might be noteworthy or interesting to highlight to others.  ^113029771

---

In general, those communicating with data need to take a more confident stance when it comes to making specific observations and recommendations based on their analysis.  ^113029772

---

Using a table in a live presentation is rarely a good idea. As your audience reads it, you lose their ears and attention to make your point verbally.  ^113029773

---

The waterfall chart can be used to pull apart the pieces of a stacked bar chart to focus on one at a time, or to show a starting point, increases and decreases, and the resulting ending point.  ^113029774

---

While tables interact with our verbal system, graphs interact with our visual system, which is faster at processing information.  ^113029775

---

When you have just a number or two that you want to communicate: use the numbers directly.  ^113029776

---

Scatterplots can be useful for showing the relationship between two things, because they allow you to encode data simultaneously on a horizontal x-axis and vertical y-axis to see whether and what relationship exists.  ^113029777

Concentrate on the pearls, the information your audience needs to know.  ^113029778
