# Highlights 
Mastering the mundane tasks of everyday life seems to be a gateway to living an extraordinary life.  ^113029608

Our grandparents had one job for life; our parents had multiple jobs over their careers; our generation will have multiple careers. This demands that we learn how to grow not as a one-time event, but as an ongoing evolution of our identity.  ^113029609

---

When life becomes dull, restrictive, and threatening you know you’re living in a story, not reality.  ^113029610

---

“Resentment is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.” You don’t stop resenting for their sake. You stop it for your own sake.  ^113029611

---

We live our lives looking for evidence that our stories are true. We want them to be right more than we want to be free. More than we want close and intimate relationships. If the story is “I’m not good enough,” then we’ll either try a bunch of things, all the while looking for evidence that the story is true; or we’ll try nothing, assuming it’s true. In either case, the story is confirmed.  ^113029612

Humans don’t think with their head, for the most part. Even the most rational, analytically minded people don’t make the important decisions using cold logic. We fundamentally think with our hearts, based on what intuitively feels right.  ^113029613

---

We blame others for things that happened in the past, making our case look as plausible and sympathetic as possible. We maintain lists of all the things our parents, our ex-s, our former friends, and our ex-bosses did so, so wrong. We collect mountains of evidence supporting these judgments. But we are always innocent in our stories, victims of their inexcusable behavior.  ^113029614

---

By selectively inflating the wrongdoing of others, our own responsibility is diminished in comparison.  ^113029615

---

I decided to write a new story for myself: that I could work closely with others, with all the vulnerability, risk, and messiness that entails. I decided that people would no longer be threats to me, but rather the most precious opportunities in my business and my life.  ^113029616

One of the best ways to start creating content is to curate content. Curation is the process of sorting through the vast amount of content from others that already exists, and picking and choosing the best or most interesting items.  ^113029617
