# Highlights 
According to the reductionist view of particle physics, all the phenomena of nature—solids, liquids, gases, living as well as inanimate matter—are reduced to the constant interaction and collision of electrons, photons, and nuclei.  ^113157714

---

This fact is of enormous importance to all of science and life in general. The continual exchange of photons between the nucleus and the atomic electrons provides the force that holds the atom together. Without those jumping photons, the atom would fly apart, and all matter would cease to exist.  ^113157715

---

Very recent astronomical discoveries exactly parallel the theoretical advances. The newest astronomical data about the size and shape of the universe provide confirmation that the universe exponentially “inflated” to a stupendous size much bigger than the standard ten or fifteen billion light-years. There is very little doubt that we are embedded in a vastly bigger megaverse.  ^113157716

---

Well, the best efforts of the best physicists, using our best theories, predict Einstein’s cosmological constant incorrectly by 120 orders of magnitude! That’s so bad that it’s funny.  ^113157717

---

When we combine the theory of elementary particles with the theory of gravity, we discover the horror of a cosmological constant big enough to not only destroy galaxies, stars, and planets but also atoms, and even protons and neutrons—unless. Unless what? Unless the various bosons, fermions, masses, and coupling constants that go into calculating the vacuum energy conspire to cancel the first 119 decimal places.  ^113157718

---

The problem is that the wrong result seems to be an inevitable consequence of our best theory of nature, quantum field theory.  ^113157719
