# Highlights 
As far as we know, quantum mechanics provides an exact description of every physical system, but some things are massive enough that quantum mechanics can be reliably approximated by classical mechanics. That’s all that classical mechanics is: an approximation.  ^113157740

The space of states of a quantum system is not a mathematical set;6 it is a vector space.  ^113157741

---

The quantum mechanical notation for the statistical average of a quantity Q is Dirac’s bracket notation ⟨Q⟩.  ^113157742

---

In quantum mechanics, the situation is fundamentally different. Any interaction that is strong enough to measure some aspect of a system is necessarily strong enough to disrupt some other aspect of the same system. Thus, you can learn nothing about a quantum system without changing something else.  ^113157743

---

What we are learning is that quantum mechanical systems are not deterministic—the results of experiments can be statistically random—but if we repeat an experiment many times, average quantities can follow the expectations of classical physics, at least up to a point.  ^113157744

---

One might say that measuring one component of the spin destroys the information about another component. In fact, one simply cannot simultaneously know the components of the spin along two different axes, not in a reproducible way in any case.  ^113157745

---

Quantum mechanically, the second measurement (σx = +1) ruins the possibility of verifying the first. Once σx has been prepared along the x axis, another mesurement of σz will give a random answer. Thus (A and B) is not confirmable: the second piece of the experiment interferes with the possibility of confirming the first piece.  ^113157746

---

The first interaction with the apparatus prepares the system in one of the two states. Subsequent experiments confirm that state. So far, there is no difference between classical and quantum physics.  ^113157747

---

Our sensory organs are simply not built to perceive the motion of an electron. The best we can do is to try to understand electrons and their motion as mathematical abstractions.  ^113157748

However, in quantum physics, the first of these propositions is completely meaningless (not even wrong), and the second one means something quite different from what you might think.  ^113157749
