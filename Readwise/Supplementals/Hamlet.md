Neither a borrower nor a lender be, For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. (80) This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.  ^113156955

To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.  ^113156959

---

When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows.  ^113156960

---

Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.  ^113156961

---

Madness in great ones must not unwatched go.  ^113156962

A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.  ^113156963
