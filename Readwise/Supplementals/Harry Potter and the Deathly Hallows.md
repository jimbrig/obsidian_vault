# Highlights 
It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.  ^61948043

---

You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.”  ^61948044

---

It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious: To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second.  ^61948045

---

“You’ve sort of made up for it tonight,” said Harry. “Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux. Saving my life.” “That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,” Ron mumbled. “Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,” said Harry. “I’ve been trying to tell you that for years.”  ^61948046

---

Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy.  ^61948047

---

“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”  ^61948048

---

“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love.  ^61948049

---

His will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death.  ^61948050

---

An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around his neck.  ^61948051

---

He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone.  ^61948052
