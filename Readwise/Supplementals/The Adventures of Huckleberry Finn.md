Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again, so I played another chicken bone and got another think. Then I says: “Blame  it, do you suppose there ain’t but one preacher to a church?” “Why, what do they want with more?”  ^113157873

“None of it at all. Not a lie in it,” says I. “Lay your hand on this book and say it.” I see it warn’t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and said it.  ^113157874

Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and smelt late. You know what I mean—I don’t know the words to put it in.  ^113157879

But there warn’t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was gone! I set up a shout—and then another—and then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn’t no use—old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn’t help it. But I couldn’t set still long.  ^113157880
