# Highlights 
So who goes on your Protemoi List? A healthy mix is usually three-quarters clients and prospects and the rest people who can help with your business development indirectly: referrers, your boss, influencers, strategic partners, or other experts you rely on.  ^61947992

Don’t rely on your prospects to calculate your value. Some will, but most won’t. It’s easier for them to compare your pricing to other options. If you don’t give the prospect a relevant number to anchor on, they could be using anything to judge it, regardless of how poor the comparison.  ^61947993

---

This means you can give clients a high simply by putting them on a soapbox. Ask them to share their perspective on what’s going on with their business or in the industry at large.  ^61947994

---

When it comes to your Protemoi List, you want to contact each person on a monthly basis, but don’t allow these interactions to become rote. Interesting news clipping from Bill—it must be the third Thursday of the month. Shake it up. Be spontaneous. They’ll notice.  ^61947995

---

If analytical, focus on high value. If practical, focus on proven process, the safe choice. If relational, focus on benefits to people the buyer empathizes with: their customers, their employees, their team, or others. If experimental, focus on strategic fit, breakthrough results, future flexibility, and innovation.  ^61947996

---

Remember reading about becoming a trusted advisor? This is how you do it. Mike doesn’t have a logo. He doesn’t have marketing materials about himself. He’s simply figured out what he wants to be known for, and he lives that promise, strengthening it with every interaction.  ^61947997

---

Your Protemoi List represents your list of potential raving fans, the people most worthy of the investment required to create this special relationship. “Investing” in a relationship might mean anything from emailing a relevant article, to calling with a cool product idea, to an invitation to brainstorm over dinner.  ^61947998

---

Winning teams have something else in common: everyone gives everyone coaching. Every person sees things. Every person has the potential to help out another. When every person is helping every person get better at every opportunity, positive change happens faster.  ^61947999

---

One of my clients develops an annual strategy for BD growth and then transforms it—minus some proprietary details—into an elegant, client-viewable document. Then he goes to his top six or seven loyal clients and raving fan clients, buys them a nice lunch, and shares the plan while asking for their advice.  ^61948000

---

Positioning communicates what problems you uniquely solve, while targeting communicates the types of people who spend money solving that unique problem.  ^61948001

---

The best rainmakers set clear criteria to rate their opportunities. They might evaluate prospects based on budget, the types of projects typically bought, the industry, or the size of the company, either in revenue or in number of employees.  ^127884795

---

There is an art to conversation. The key to being a master conversationalist is to listen at least as much as you talk and to answer questions with enough detail to continue the flow of ideas.  ^127884796

---

When you have an opportunity to talk about yourself, start with what I call a curious introduction: a short, provocative statement that creates interest and generates questions. It gets a head nod, a buy-in.  ^127884797

---

The beginning of a relationship is a delicate time: mess it up, and it’s very tough to recover. Get it right, and you build momentum that is hard to stop.  ^127884798

---

The most effective way to do this is to maintain an Asset List, a list of items you always have at hand to quickly send your Protemoi contacts to create easy R+ experiences.  ^127884799

---

Write draft goals for the project based on what you learned at the listen-and-learn stage. Let the client know these will only be 60 to 80 percent right and invite their edits.  ^127884800

---

Interacting with us and our product or service should become a habit for our new client. That’s why the first weeks and months of the relationship are by far the most important.  ^127884801

---

The easiest way to shape someone’s opinion of you is to say what you’re going to do and then do what you said you would, over and over and over again.  ^127884806

---

Here’s the deal: the final concession should never be on price. No last-minute discounts—what could send a worse message? Instead, think of another valuable, nonmonetary concession you could make that would give the prospect that small but satisfying victory at the close of the deal. Have it in your back pocket for when you hear the magic words, “one last thing.”  ^127884807

---

Protemoi (pro′-tuh-moy) is Greek for “first among equals.” Your Protemoi List will help you invest in your most important relationships, whether there is an active engagement or not.  ^127884808

---

I hope to ping each of my fifty-six contacts once a month with something valuable that’s not a pitch to hire me but instead emphasizes my expertise.  ^168900774

---

Use their words, reflecting their situation in their words instead of falling back on generic industry lingo. Be helpful and suggest the next incremental interaction.  ^168900775

---

Showing the outputs or process of the give-to-get helps prospects say yes. Without examples of what they’ll get, the offer is too vague.  ^168900776

---

Take out a blank sheet of paper and, in a few words, write down why you want to get better at business development.  ^168900777

---

True rainmakers always have the client’s best interests in mind. I believe that. It’s what I practice and what I teach.  ^168900778

---

Hand them a deal that’s already constructed, and they can only add value in one way: by finding problems with it.  ^168900779

---

Business development is the craft of finding the right prospect and then designing the perfect buying experience for that prospect.  ^168900780

---

Without a strategy, experts often end up publishing these articles in publications read by their peers but not their clients.  ^168900781

---

Used systematically, the gravitas model broadens and deepens a conversation in a way that people will immediately notice.  ^168900782

---

A lead is created when an individual or business shows interest in your services and provides contact information.  ^168900783

---

From now on, you’re going to treat lead generation as an investment of your most precious resource: time.  ^178987413

---

Creating curiosity in others is not an inborn talent; it’s a skill, and one that can be learned.  ^178987414

---

Your goal in every interaction is to create lots of R+ experiences for the other person.  ^178987415

---

Once you’ve established a logical value anchor, your fees will suddenly seem much more reasonable.  ^178987416

---
