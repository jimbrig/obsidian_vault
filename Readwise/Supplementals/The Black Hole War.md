# Highlights 
The most notable inhabitants of the universe—the galaxies—are built around giant black holes that are continually gobbling up stars and planets. Out of every 10,000,000,000 bits of information in the universe, 9,999,999,999 are associated with the horizons of black holes. It should be evident that our naive ideas about space, time, and information are wholly inadequate to understand most of nature.  ^61948063

Entropy is a measure of how much information is hidden in the details—details that for one reason or another are too hard to observe. Thus, entropy is hidden information.  ^61948064

---

The objective reality of points of space and instants of time is on its way out, going the way of simultaneity,7 determinism,8 and the dodo. Quantum gravity describes a much more subjective reality than we ever imagined. As we will see in chapter 18, it is a reality that in many ways is like the ghostly three-dimensional illusion cast by a hologram.  ^61948065

---

Adding one bit of information will increase the area of the horizon of any black hole by one Planck unit of area, or one square Planck unit.  ^61948066

---

This new law of physics, known as the Holographic Principle, asserts that everything inside a region of space can be described by bits of information restricted to the boundary.  ^61948067

---

These units—the Planck length, time, and mass—have an extraordinary meaning: they are the size, half-life, and mass of the smallest possible black hole.  ^61948068

---

But Black Hole Complementarity was proposing something far more radical. Depending on the state of motion of the observer, an atom might remain a tiny microscopic object, or it might spread out over the entire horizon of an enormous black hole.  ^61948069

---

It seems that information is lost only when we actively intervene with the electron. In Quantum Mechanics, as long as we don’t interfere with a system, the information that it carries is as indestructible as it is in classical physics.  ^61948070

---

It is one of the deepest and most profound laws of nature we have discovered: The maximum amount of information that can be stuffed into a region of space is equal to the area of the region, not the volume.  ^61948071
