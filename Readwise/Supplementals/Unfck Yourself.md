# Highlights 
Assertive self-talk is when you stake a claim for this moment of time, right here and now. When you start to talk in terms of “I am…” or “I embrace…” or “I accept…” or “I assert…,” all of which are powerful and commanding uses of language rather than the narrative of “I will…” or “I’m going to…”  ^61948082

If you’re not willing to take the actions to change your situation—in other words, if you’re willing to put up with your situation—then, whether you like it or not, that is the life you have chosen.  ^61948083

How we talk about, think about, and therefore perceive our surroundings is the very foundation for our reality. Create the reality you want to live in by beginning the process of having the kind of conversations, with yourself and others, that actually shape that reality.  ^61948084

You’re never going to achieve your true potential if you’re hooked by what other people think. In fact, you could change your life overnight if you simply abandoned the notion that other people’s opinions matter. Life goes on, opinion heavy or opinion light.  ^61948085

To fully embrace my approach, you must first accept that while there are things that have happened in your life that you had no say in, you are 100% responsible for what you do with your life in the aftermath of those events. Always, every time, no excuses.  ^61948086

---

If you’re sometimes talking about how “unfair” life is, you’ll start to act according to that view, perceiving slights where none exist or, as studies have shown, putting less effort into your work because you’ve already determined it won’t accomplish anything. The unfair view will quickly become your reality.  ^61948087

---

In other words, our aversion to risk, which was once necessary, no longer is. Those same survival instincts that once kept us alive can now be the very thing that keeps us from actually living.  ^61948088

I’ve given you seven personal assertions. “I am willing.” “I am wired to win.” “I got this.” “I embrace the uncertainty.” “I am not my thoughts; I am what I do.” “I am relentless.” “I expect nothing and accept everything.”  ^61948089

---

The key to becoming relentless is to focus on the problem in front of you. Give it your full attention. Become someone who progresses even when all seems lost.  ^61948090

“I am not my thoughts; I am what I do.”  ^61948091
