# Highlights 
The poem promotes but also questions its own fantasies and ideals, such as the idea that time and change can be undone, and the notion that there is such a thing as home, where people and relationships can stay forever the same.  ^113029671

In The Odyssey, we find instead the story of a man whose grand adventure is simply to go back to his own home, where he tries to turn everything back to the way it was before he went away. For this hero, mere survival is the most amazing feat of all.  ^113029672

Human beings have short lives.330 If we are cruel, everyone will curse us during our life, and mock us when we die. The names of those who act with nobleness are brought by travelers across the world, and many people speak about their goodness.”  ^113029673

In Greek mythology, Memory (Mnemosyne) is said to be the mother of the Muses, because poetry, music, and storytelling are all imagined as modes by which people remember the times before they were born.  ^113029674

---

The Odyssey puts us into a world that is a peculiar mixture of the strange and the familiar. The tension between strangeness and familiarity is in fact the poem’s central subject.  ^113029675

The story begins in an unexpected place, in medias res (“in the middle of things”—the proper starting point for an epic, according to Horace).  ^113029676

---

The near consensus is that, at some point between the late eighth and late seventh century, a hundred-year-long window, The Odyssey was composed.  ^113029677

---

Through its formulaic mode, The Odyssey assures us that, once we know the patterns, the world will follow a predictable rhythm.  ^113029678

---

“This is absurd, that mortals blame the gods! They say we cause their suffering, but they themselves increase it by folly.  ^113029679

---

Nothing can be more glorious for a man, in a whole lifetime, than what he achieves with hands and feet.  ^113029680
