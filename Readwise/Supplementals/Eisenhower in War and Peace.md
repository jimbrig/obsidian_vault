# Highlights 
As more than one observer has written, Eisenhower’s handling of the Quemoy-Matsu crisis was a tour de force. It was one of the great victories of his career, and the key had been his coolness under pressure—his calculated use of ambiguity and deception. Eisenhower was comfortable wrestling with uncertainty.  ^113157603

Wartime presidents are not perfect. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus during the Civil War, and Franklin Roosevelt authorized the internment of Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor. Eisenhower’s Cold War use of the CIA to topple the legitimately elected governments of Iran and Guatemala represents a similar reaction.  ^113157604

“Never bring me a sealed envelope,” said Ike. “That’s what I have a staff for.”33 To Eisenhower, a sealed envelope was concrete proof the White House was badly organized. Letters to the president must be screened, and only those that were essential for him to read should be placed before him.  ^113157605

“Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired,” said Eisenhower, “signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.”  ^113157606

The establishment of the Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) was an unprecedented achievement in coalition warfare, and reflected the extraordinary ability of Roosevelt and Churchill to find common ground.  ^113157607

Those who would criticize Eisenhower for not moving fast enough on civil rights should remember that it was his judicial nominees who made the revolution possible.  ^113157608

---

Except for the occasional Medici prince in Renaissance Florence, there were few politicians other than Lyndon Johnson who could have framed such a scheme.  ^113157609

---

“No soldier could face danger or responsibility more calmly than he. These qualities are more rarely found than genius or physical courage.”  ^113157610

Between June 13 and the end of September 1944, the Germans launched more than 8,000 V-1s against Britain, killing more than 6,000 persons and injuring another 20,000.  ^113157611

Eisenhower’s decision to accept personal responsibility for the U-2 flights may have been the finest hour of his presidency.  ^113157612
