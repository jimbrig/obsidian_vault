# Highlights 
When you do schoolwork, be it reading, taking notes, working on a lab, or memorizing verbs, try to do everything in fifty-minute chunks. Take ten-minute breaks in between each fifty-minute chunk. This is key for any successful student.  ^113029845

You should build your entire approach to studying around the concept that making yourself recall specific information is the absolute best way to learn.  ^113029846

---

You should never begin studying without a systemized plan for what you are going to review, in what format, and how many times.  ^113029847

---

The secret is to read chapter introductions and conclusions carefully, and then skim everything else. Make tick marks next to sentences that catch your attentionâ€”this is faster than highlighting.  ^113029848

---

When assigned a long-term project, finish some amount of work toward its completion that very same day.  ^113029849

---

To be a successful student, you must abandon the start-slow, end-fast mind-set, and instead approach all projects by aiming to start fast, end slow.  ^113029850

---

Make sure that you always ask at least one question at every lecture.  ^113029851

---

You should try to attend at least two guest lectures every month.  ^113029852

---

Relax for at least half an hour before you go to sleep.  ^113029853

---

Because a clean room creates a focused mind; a messy room creates a distracted mind.  ^113029854
