# Highlights 
The Infinity Principle   To shed light on any continuous shape, object, motion, process, or phenomenon—no matter how wild and complicated it may appear—reimagine it as an infinite series of simpler parts, analyze those, and then add the results back together to make sense of the original whole.  ^113157704

Thus, calculus proceeds in two phases: cutting and rebuilding. In mathematical terms, the cutting process always involves infinitely fine subtraction, which is used to quantify the differences between the parts. Accordingly, this half of the subject is called differential calculus. The reassembly process always involves infinite addition, which integrates the parts back into the original whole. This half of the subject is called integral calculus.  ^113157705

Three mysteries above all have spurred its development: the mystery of curves, the mystery of motion, and the mystery of change.  ^113157706

---

That’s the big idea behind calculus. Everything becomes simpler at infinity.  ^113157707

---

The truly radical and distinctive move of calculus is that it takes this divide-and-conquer strategy to its utmost extreme—all the way out to infinity.  ^113157708

---

Calculus, like other forms of mathematics, is much more than a language; it’s also an incredibly powerful system of reasoning.  ^113157709

---

Such equations describe the difference between something right now and the same thing an instant later or between something right here and the same thing infinitesimally close by.  ^113157710

---

The breakthrough came from insisting that curves were actually made of straight pieces. It wasn’t true, but one could pretend that it was.  ^113157711

---

“The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve.”  ^113157712

During the Inquisition, the renegade monk Giordano Bruno was burned alive at the stake for suggesting that God, in His infinite power, created innumerable worlds.  ^113157713
