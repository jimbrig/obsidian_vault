# Highlights 
A set is a collection of objects, and a function is an association of members of one set to members of another.  ^113029681

Look for theorems or formulas that allow you to calculate because calculation is an effective way to get into a subject.  ^113029682

Question: How many months have 28 days? Mathematician’s answer: All of them.  ^113029683

Suppose that X and Y are two sets. The intersection of X and Y, denoted X ∩ Y, is the set consisting of elements that are in X and in Y . We can define the set as X ∩ Y = {x | x X and x Y }.  ^113029684

If A B and B A are both true, we say that A and B are logically equivalent statements and write AB. The sign is read as ‘if and only if’ and the statement is called a biconditional statement.  ^113029685

---

The difference of X and Y, denoted X\Y, is the set of elements that are in X but not in Y. That is, we take elements of X and discard those that are also in Y .  ^113029686

With the experience from solving an easier problem it might be possible to solve the general one. So for example, in problem (i) it may be easier to work with 10! rather than 100!.  ^113029687

Unfortunately, they are not taught to have a questioning nature, they are taught to have an answering nature. They expect us to ask questions and for them to give the answers because that is they way they have been educated. This book aims to give them the questions they need to ask so they don’t need me anymore.  ^113029688

Another simple test involves the idea of parity. This is easier to see in action than give a good definition. The equation 512 = 342 + 462 is false. This is easy to see without any calculation: The left-hand side is odd and the right-hand side is even.  ^113029689
