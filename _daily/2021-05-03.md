> I wanted to achieve something essential in life, something that is not measured by money or position in society. The mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambitions to achieve. They are my cathedrals, the houses of my religion. In the mountains I attempt to understand my life. They are the way I practice my religion. In the mountains I celebrate creation, on each journey I am reborn.

## 📝 Notes:

### FD&BR

- Travis D'Arneau hurt for Braves -> Options include:
	- **William Contreras** - Advice: Contreras kicked off the scoring with a two-out RBI single to left field off Ross Stripling in the second inning. With veteran backstop Travis d'Arnaud sidelined for the next two months due to a sprained left thumb, the 23-year-old catching prospect will get an extended opportunity, alongside fellow youngster Alex Jackson, to show he belongs at the major-league level. He's worthy of a speculative roster spot in deeper mixed leagues and two-catcher formats. (<https://NBCSportsEDGE.com>)
	- Austin Jackson on IL
