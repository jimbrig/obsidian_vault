## üìù Notes:

- New [[R Development|R]] version `4.1.0` notes:
	- Introduced the new `|>` pipe operator:
		- Notable differences between `|>` and `%>%` from [magrittr](https://github.com/tidyverse/magrittr) include:
			- Have to include `()` at end of pipe to complete the function
			- Cannot specify manually the location of the argument via `.` like you can with magrittr, must be the first argument

	- Introduced a new way of specifying temporary functions via `\(<args>)`
