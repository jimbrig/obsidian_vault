Tasks:

- [ ] Review all code in `plumber.R` and refactor accordingly - think MVP, speed, no unnecessary enhancements just because they seem *cool* and worth learning.
- [ ] Replace all [[R-Packages: DBI| DBI]] `DBI::dbConnect` connection `conn` objects with [[R-Packages: pool| Pool]] (i.e. `pool::poolCreate`, `pool::poolCheckout`, etc.)
- [ ] Review Transactions for Database ensuring are working properly though unit tests.
- [ ] Implement full test suite against API endpoints and authentication filters.
- [ ] Create a  `/customers/<customer_uid>/locations` endpoint to `GET` (retrieve), `POST` (add new), and `PUT` (update existing) REST Methods.
- [ ] Limit all payloads sent between requests and responses to the minimum amount of data necessary and collaborate with Patrick on how to optimize these responses with additional restructuring
